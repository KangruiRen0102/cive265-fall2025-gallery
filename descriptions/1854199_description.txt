1.I wanted to design a pavilion that looked trippy and unique, while also leaving the area around it feeling open and not very constricting. Something you can walk through and admire on your way through it. I made sure to use lines in order to contour a curve within the design. As it makes you wonder how such straight lines can give you the illusion of something bending. ii) I believe this pavilion is a perfect candidate for the Week of welcoming at the UofA. As it shows the uniqueness and technical skills such as the engineering and attention to detail that the university has to offer. It's something a brand new student can lay back on, enjoying the breeze and sunshine through the spaces within the design. This design also shows symbolism to those who dive deeper into its funky curls and spokes. Students may come from anywhere in the world. We may have different hobbies and different people we hang out with. We are the outer curve. In reality we all came to this university for a reason. To learn and grow. Which is why we are all connected to the center line of this pavilion. 2. I spent a decent amount of time trying to give the spokes of my pavilion a curvy illusion. I found that adding more spokes connected to the curve and the center beam exaggerated this idea. I also found that having these spokes the same width took away from the purpose of it standing out. It contrasted the pavilion by making it look flat and dull. Therefore to exaggerate my purpose of this design, I made sure the spoke grew thicker as they spiraled down the curve. I have fine-tuned these parameters using sliders to maximize aesthetics, as this is one of the main objectives for a pavilion.
