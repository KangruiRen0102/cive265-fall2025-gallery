My pavilion is uses different materials in combination to form an nice area with shade, by allows the wind to come through as well. The idea of using multiple materials to make one pavilion shows unity. The multiply bars and columns in the design are for flexibility and allows air flow within the pavilion. The steel roof provides shade as well as cover from the rain. Both features would be useful depending on the weather during week of welcome. I think that the pavilion shows how something can be a creative idea as well as a practical feature. The creativity part was the creation of the unique pavilion. While designing this Pavilion I felt that it could be a gathering place where students can meet in community during week of welcome. This pavilion can be used to make new friends and foster a sense of community on campus. The feature that I made be able to change were the thickness of the wooden beams and the space between the poles and the diameters of the poles. These choices were made so that when constructing the pavilion there would be options based on the materials that are available. I believe that making these different choices could suite the space better. Like if we wanted the sides to be more defined we could make the diameter of the bars larger or space them closer together. It you wanted a more open feeling make the radii smaller and/or space them farther apart. The fluidity in the design can allow the pavilion to have what every feeling you want it to.
