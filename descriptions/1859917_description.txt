My design focuses on functionality. It centers on a large pillar with a conical roof that provides shade from the sun and protection from rainfall while directing runoff. A series of steps around the base of the pillar offers seating for pedestrians, allowing people to sit alone or in groups. The extended roof also creates shaded areas on the surrounding grass, giving visitors the option to relax either on the steps or on the grass. The structure is meant to promote relaxation, as the single central pillar keeps the shaded area open and unobstructed. The tiered steps support this by providing multiple seating rows, encouraging groups to gather comfortably near the center. This creates a sense of community around the pillar, while the outer shaded edges can remain quieter and more private for those seeking a calmer environment.

My parametric controls adjust the shape of both the concrete pillar and the straw cone roof. The main concrete pillar can change in height, cylinder count, middle thickness, and the extension of the outer rings. Height determines how open and welcoming the space feels, while the other parameters affect the seating: deeper steps offer more room, the middle thickness sets how high the seating rises, and changing the cylinder count alters the number of seating levels. These adjustments allow the structure to feel either more spacious and relaxed or more intimate and communal. Two additional parameters influence the roof. Adjusting the roof height affects the structure’s appearance, while changing its width alters its functionality. A wider conical roof increases the shaded radius, creating secluded, comfortable areas farther from the pillar, which may be more ideal for individuals who prefer a quieter, and more relaxing space.

(As a side note, i found that sometimes changing the parameters too quickly will break boxes sometimes, but copying and pasting these broken boxes will solve the issue, so i provided debuggers at the bottom)
