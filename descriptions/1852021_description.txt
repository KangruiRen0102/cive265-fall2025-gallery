For my pavilion I wanted pedestrians to experience a sense of calmness that contrasts the busy activities of Week of Welcome. The open bamboo columns create a light, open structure that encourages relaxation, while the aluminum roof provides shade and a quiet sense of shelter. I kept the ground level fully open so people can move through the space freely and remain connected to the outdoor energy around them. The cone-shaped roof, inspired by the form of a lantern, reinforces this idea of calm illumination and gentle gathering.
The pavilion form was developed through parametric controls that allowed continuous testing of proportion, spacing, and height. Parameters such as the radius of the overall footprint, the number of columns, and the roof’s height were adjusted to study how each variable affected circulation and enclosure. By modifying column spacing, I could control how open the pavilion felt and ensure accessibility. Adjusting the cone height changed the balance between openness and shelter, helping refine the emotional tone of the interior. These parameters made it possible to iterate quickly and arrive at a configuration where structure, experience, and purpose align.
