My pavilion consists of two lines of wooden beam on each side of the structure. On each side, there are eight square beams in a line that all go up to seven meters above the ground. The middle beam on both sides of the pavilion is missing so only the other beams will support the roof. The roof in question is made out of steel and covers all of the area of the wooden beam as well as some extra space on the edges. In the middle of that roof is a hole. 

The purpose of my pavilion is to allow for plants to grow on the beams, roof and overall structure of it to welcome students who may or may not come from Edmonton to observe and take-in the diversity of plants the city has. The most prominent feature of the pavilion – the circular roof is intended to have plants growing either through or below it and it also acts as a way for plants below the roof to get sunlight. 

During my design process the use of parametric controls allowed me to create a design matched well with my ideas in mind. As mentioned before, I wanted my pavilion to resemble a prison cell and bring two parameters into question: the width, and the number of beams supporting the roof. In beam’s case, without the parametric control change these 2 variables would have been a lot harder since I wanted there to be more than at least 4 or more total to support the roof which would have required me to change each value one by one. However, the availability of a slider allowed me to change by design in real time to accurately reflect my ideas at each step of my process.
