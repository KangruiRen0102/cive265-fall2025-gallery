he design of my pavilion is centered around the idea of acceptance and embrace—a continuous, twisting roof surface that creates a sense of arrival and intrigue as students enter campus during the Week of Welcome. The undulating ribs form a dynamic wave that visually pulls people inward, while the soft curvature and repeated lines create a calming rhythm once underneath. My main goal was to create an experience that feels both energizing and relaxing: intriguing from a distance, yet peaceful within the structure. This reflects Week of Welcome itself—students arriving with anticipation, then settling into a community environment.
The pavilion is supported by a series of steel poles, each placed with a specific experiential purpose. Two poles serve as the primary structural supports, positioned at low points where the canopy naturally presses downward. The remaining poles act as spatial definition elements: they outline the edges of the pavilion, subtly marking where the covered zone begins. These poles frame the pavilion like a soft boundary, encouraging visitors to move through the center while providing reference points that anchor the dynamic geometry to the ground. Only some poles include wooden bases, intentionally added to contrast with the colder steel beams and bring warmth to the project.
Parametric controls were essential in shaping the final form. Sliders allowed me to adjust roof height, rib count, spacing, curve amplitude, and twist angle. By exploring these parameters, I tested how different geometries affected shade, openness, and the sense of movement through the pavilion. Adjusting pole height helped refine how much structural presence or visual lightness the design should have. Iterating through parameter sets led to a pavilion that feels uplifting and expressive—an inviting landmark for students experiencing the campus energy during Week of Welcome.
