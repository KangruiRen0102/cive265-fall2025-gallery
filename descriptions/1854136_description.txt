1. Design concept and user experience: (i) The kind of experience I want pedestrians to have at The Steel Forest is a sense of forest mystery, the big timber and steel will bring a sense of interest amongst students, as it has a nature vibe that fits the aesthetic of the Week of Welcome on the grounds. Students can "hide" and even study, just sit up against any of the "trees" and relax and do whatever they need to do. The steel above provides shade and shelter, whilst still keeping an open atmosphere. (ii) This brings a sense of relaxation towards students, so they can forget their busy lives for a few moments and take a rest in the forest. 

2. I used four sliders: 1. Pavillion Width 2. Pavillion Length 3. Column Height 4. Column Spacing. Adjusting the "Column Spacing" parameter I can control the space in between the column providing more space for people to walk and also keeping that "forest" look. I found adjusting the "Column Height" parameter, I was able to set the atmosphere, a low column height created a oppresive feeling, the higher setting created a better more open atmosphere which is ideal for public relaxation. Pavillion height and length controlled how big and the relative shape I wanted the forest to be, a square or a rectangle. A big square or a small square or a big rectangle or a small rectangle or the orientation of the rectangle. These parameters helped me a lot in determining the ideal pavillion style for The Steel Forest.
