My pavilion is a small pyramid type inspired structure with four base points and one apex as the top point. I kept two sides of the pyramid as open creating pathways for movement and allowing sunlight and ventilation. On the open sides, I also added curved arc beams. These arcs help frame the entrances and makes the pavilion more aesthetic. In the center there is a tower that adds height and supports the whole structure of beams. Class members used are Timber for beams and Steel for wall. The design is parametric and using sliders we can change height, wallthickness, beam thickness, covered area on ground and it automatically updates the volumes of the material used.
