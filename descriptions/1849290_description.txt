The Nexus Arch pavilion is designed as a welcoming space where people can meet up and connect during welcome week. The shape and size of it gives it a clear presence in the main Quad, where students can take a break before heading to their next class. As people walk under the arch, the diagonal steel lattice and timber ribs let in plenty of sunlight while still creating a noticeable shift in atmosphere, making the space feel intentional without being closed off. Along the bottom on the left side and the middle, the integrated bench acts as the main functional feature. It blends in and gives students an easy place to sit together which makes it much more likely for people to talk and make friends, or just relax between classes. The right side of the pavilion with no benches also helps with traffic flow letting people pass through freely or stand and chat without feeling crowded. The overall shape and layout were edited using parametric controls, adjusting things like the arch height to find the right balance between openness and shelter. The number of ribs and the density of the steel lattice were tuned so the pavilion still looks visually interesting while allowing as much sunlight as possible, like a sunny gathering spot meant for appreciating Edmonton's beautiful weather while it lasts. Even the bench width was carefully adjusted to fit as many people as comfortably as possible, supporting the main goal of creating a friendly and social space right on the main quad.
