The design I have created depicts a wooden staircase being held up by a set of steel fingers. Here the cylindrical rods represent the “helping hands” (or fingers) of the University of Alberta, presenting the “steps to success” which are shown by the wooden stairs. The set of stairs is made of wood to represent the unpolished sense of understanding for the university students that arriving during the week of welcome. On the other side the steel fingers show the strong, sturdy grip of the university. This includes the good reputation, solid foundation, and overall, well constructed system the university provides to its students.

I intend for students to feel a sense of welcoming and strong support. The contrast between the strength of the university (steel) and the unpolished, yet strong and capable students (wood) should provide a sense of welcoming but also a realistic understanding that the road ahead will not be easy. The steps should also show a sense of welcoming by showing that there is a path to the end, and that by sticking to the plan laid out by the university, you will be successful. By placing this in the middle of the main quad, a sense of community is created as well. Having it there shows that everybody has the same overall journey (since everybody usually goes through the main quad at some point). 

The main parametric controls I used were changing the number of stairs and fingers, and radius. I looked at the number of stairs and fingers and used a number slider to visualize how different amounts of the stairs and fingers would look in relation to the overall size of the space. I found that putting in too many, would create a clogged space and could take away from the welcoming feel by overwhelming the students by making the process look “too hard”. I also changed the radius to allow for a sense of the strength the university provides. A higher radius would provide more strength and vice versa.
