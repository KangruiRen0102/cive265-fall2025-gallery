It was supposed to be inspired by the shape of the Alberta Wild Rose which was something I looked forward to seeing during landtrips to Banff and the Rockies when I see license plates that say 'Wild Rose Country.' The design was initially supposed to be a curved stem with slightly drooping petals that cover a wide area and a 5-cogged gear in the middle to represent the industries here but making all of that happen was too difficult to do. Closest thing I got to making the petals was following a video by Robin Kandia but I didn't understand how he did it so I settled for an ellipse. I also just extended the gear circle to intersect both structures since I was also having trouble in connecting the petal rotations to the cylinder arc.
