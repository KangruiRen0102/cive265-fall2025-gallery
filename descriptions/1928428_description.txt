The Welcome Canopy Pavilion serves as a strong and beautiful counterpart to those energetic WoW events with a focus more on relaxation and retreat.

As for design, this treehouse has a familiar and comforting shape. A wide and low conical roof stands on six evenly spaced pillars. A strong and multi-tiered circular foundation secures everything. The grey and dark green colors symbolize a persistent theme. Six pillars allow for optimal strength with constant visibility. The multi-tiered foundation with steps ensures inherent seating. This simplifies architecture to basic social elements.

Primarily: community creation and relaxation. The Canopy serves as a deliberate distinct identifier and meetings point. The circular design invites dialogue and engages a broad range of attendees with inherent seating encouraging lingering. As a physical retreat, the large, low-slung roof ensures coverage for maximum shade provision for sun protection. This definitely identifies a true zone where one can breathe. Symbolic for stability within a temporary WoW environment.

The resulting design was a direct function of parametric influences. The original design had a pitched roof that was made more conical with a flat rim for a strong shade effect with a function directly supporting rest. The number of columns was changed to six instead of eight to give a cleaner design. Finally, three steps were assigned for the foundation. This serves a dual role that qualifies this design as a landmark design with comfortable seating that fulfills the function of serving the community.
