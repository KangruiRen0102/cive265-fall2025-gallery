I wanted to create a cool geometric design for people to walk through and or take pictures with when they first arrive on campus to cultivate a sense of arrival and awe for the university campus. The cuboid design was chosen based on CCIS and UCOMMs which both have cuboid designs but feature some warmth through the brick. In my design the steel frames form the geometric cuboid shape while the wooden planks bring a bit of warmth to the design. Both materials are also rust/weathering resistant which make them ideal for the seasonal changes within Edmonton and are also low maintenance.

I had parametric controls for both materials in my design. For the steel frames the length, width, number of frames, and degree of rotation could be adjusted to account for the desired traffic rate (how many people can walk through while next to each other at once; length), thickness of the frames, and the desired fluidity of design (ie. more frames at different degrees of rotation will provide a tighter/more fluid spiral). For the wood platform, the width and length of each wooden plank along with the number of planks was adjustable to desirable parameters. All parameters may be decided by the aesthetics of the outcomes and material and labor costs (ie. more frames/planks would cost more to obtain and install).
