I designed my pavilion with inspiration from the Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science (CCIS) and from my own experience as a woman pursuing higher education. I wanted to provide shelter from snow or rain, which is why I chose to add an angled ceiling connected to the steel pipes. I decided to make the roof out of glass in reference to the phrase "break the glass ceiling". I intend to inspire pedestrians to pursue higher education. In addition to providing cover from the weather, the pavilion represents the fight for women's rights. It reminds people of how far we've come and how far we still have to go. 

The pavilion represents the theme of the Week of Welcome. It's a sign that the University of Alberta is part of a community of women seeking knowledge. This establishes a sense of excitement and peace. 

The parametric controls I chose are the heights, radii, and number of steel rods. As well as the thickness of the glass pane. I wanted to create a tunnel effect, which is why I chose the number of steel rods and the wider radii so as to make sure there was little gap between each rod. The height can be adjusted depending on the budget of the project. The shorter the rods, the less material is needed, and the cheaper the pavilion is to build. I chose the thickness of the glass to ensure that it wouldn't break under stress, as it would create a major safety issue. The ability to adjust these parameters helped me fine-tune my design in order to convey the right message.
