The Week of Welcome is busy and lively place so taking the time away from some sun and meeting new people in and around a pavilion with a relaxed and calming environment. The pavilion provides some shade but does let light pass through, so it can be a communal area that meets people's wants and needs. The steel posts provide stability with changing heights and radii to refine the pavilion's overall design. The wooden panels of the roof are able to change width and thickness depending on the shade coverage wanted.
