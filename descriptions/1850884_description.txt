I decided to go with a simple pavilion with a shelter. The overall concept is based on the 4 timber columns supporting a steel roof and 4 beams at the top. I also included a circular light bulb for better vision at night. The roof is made of a square, which acts as a base and 4 triangular surfaces. During the Week of Welcome, almost all pedestrians would be tired from all the walking, sightseeing, or campus tours. The purpose of this pavilion is to provide shade and shelter to all the pedestrians. People can stop by to meet, rest, or take a break between events. I want people to feel welcome by offering free drinks and snacks for everybody who passes by. The vibe would be comforting and relaxing, which is why I decided to go with timber since it gives a warm and inviting vibe.
Parametric controls were used to determine the size and structure of my pavilion, as well as the area and volume of its different parts of the pavilion. For the height of 4 columns, I went with 3 meters since it's a safe distance away from people, and it's not too high to the point where people could bump their heads on. The distance between each column would be 5 meters. I tried to make it not too wide so that pedestrians can have some kind of comfort. I decided to stick with this size and structure because my whole purpose is to give a warm and friendly vibe where people would feel welcome to stay back and rest. The maximum capacity for my pavilion is 15 people, since some people would come and go, and some would stay back. Adjusting the parameters allowed me to see how the structure would look; even the small changes could impact the appearance and possibly fail the criteria of 10 m x 10 m. Overall, I believe that the size of my pavilion is well-balanced with my intention of creating an uplifting and comforting vibe for the pedestrians during the Week of Welcome.
