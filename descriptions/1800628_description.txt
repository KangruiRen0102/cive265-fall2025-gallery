My design concept involves enchanted forest that highlights purple visuals. The triangular aspect makes it feel like you are walking through a tranquil path through the forest fit to destress from daily lives. I used parametric controls to form the angles at which beams falter and also use it to change the divisions of some columns in my design. Adjusting these features helped me play around with the looks while also coming up with an overall concept. Having parametric controls made the designing part more fulfilling.
