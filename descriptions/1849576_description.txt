The Horizon Halo is a welcoming gateway that encourages gathering and connection throughout the week of welcome. Its circular form symbolizes unity and inclusivity, creating a very popular space. The circular steel ribs that are not fully enclosed creates a sense of connection between the inside of the pavilion and the people that are walking outside. As people move beneath the pavilion they will notice the glass paneled roof, this allows for natural light to enter the structure but also provide shelter from outside conditions. This space evokes curiosity and calmness along with a sense of celebration as it is the week of welcome. The wide opening creates an inviting threshold that allows for students to flow freely in and out of the pavilion, while enhancing visibility and collective gathering. Ultimately, the space is a shared landmark that is simple yet inviting for new or returning students to enjoy each other's company. The horizon halo provides a place for students to orient themselves, reinforcing a strong first impression of the campus community. Parametric controls were central to shaping this experience. By being able to adjust parameters such as circular steel rods, the height, radius and roof overhang, it allowed for multiple design variations to be explored and find what would benefit the design the most. By finding an amount of steel rods that maintained inclusivity for everyone but also kept the area enclosed, the pavilion was able to achieve a visual dynamism with spatial comfort. Modifying the glass roof's radius refined the pavilion's sense of scale and presence, ensuring it felt welcoming but steered away from overwhelming. The opening of the pavilion is adjusted to maintain structural integrity but also ensure that the sense of openness is present. Through testing different possibilities, the final form achieves a blend of openness and structural clarity that aligns with the pavilion's purpose as vibrant and inviting.
