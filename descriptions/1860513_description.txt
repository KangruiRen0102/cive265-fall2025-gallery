The pavilion is titled the Oak of New Beginnings Pavilion, a name chosen because the oak tree represents strength, renewal, and steady growth, which fits the start of a new school year. Week of Welcome brings together new and returning students, so the pavilion was designed to act as a clear, recognizable starting point on the site. The form takes the three main parts of a tree and translates them into architectural systems: a trunk, a canopy, and acorn-inspired seating. The central trunk is a tall lattice made from circular rings connected by rods. It is open rather than solid, creating a vertical structure that frames the sky while still remaining light. Above it, a curved canopy is formed by lofted surfaces between rings of increasing radius. This creates a bowl-like shape similar to branching limbs, providing shade and definition without closing off the space. The surfaces are slightly transparent, allowing light to filter through and giving the pavilion a shifting appearance throughout the day. Around the trunk, eight acorn-shaped seating pods offer small semi-enclosed places to sit. Their positions and rotations were tested in multiple arrangements, eventually balancing inward and outward orientations to support both group interaction and quieter moments. Parametric design tools guided the development of every system. Sliders controlled ring radii, rod thickness, canopy transparency, and seat placement, allowing quick exploration of different proportions and layouts. Python classes were also used to generate rods and seats as instances and calculate their surface areas, keeping the geometric and material systems consistent with assignment requirements. Overall, the Oak of New Beginnings Pavilion uses a clear organizational idea and parametric flexibility to create a functional and readable space for Week of Welcome.
