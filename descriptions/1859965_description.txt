My design was inspired by a dome, almost like what you would see in ancient Rome. It is a dome with open arches so it can be entered from any side, making it welcoming. The main body is made out of Steel which is intended to be colored green and the arches are made of gold. The colors make a reference to our school colors, green and gold. The design highlights the school's excellence through the use of historic architecture. I feel like domes are used in places of great importance, such as churches, big libraries or temples, and I wanna share that feeling with the students.
There is ample space within the dome for event coordinators to organize stands or small events.

I started by creating a sphere mesh. I realized that I could get the edges of the sections of the mesh to create a set of lines. I then deleted the bottom half of the sphere by limiting the height of the Endpoints and Startpoints in the Sphere lines. This created a dome. Following lesson two on dynamo, I created a class (steel rods) that used the lines on my dome and a radius to create rods. 

I isolated the lowest circle of points in the dome and copied it to create two circles. I connected these two circles of points to create a thick middle section. This section creates a nice pattern that makes the pavilion look more interesting.

I placed arches on the bottom and connected them to the top.
