1. The Gateway of Fluidity: My design rationale was to create a figurative and literal gateway of welcome. That both functions as a learning and relaxation space as well as a symbolic gateway into the university.

(i) I want pedestrians to be able to use the concrete spheres as resting places to either sit down on or lean up against. To either use them to rest or study. I also want them to take advantage of the arch of shade that will be cast from the arch of wooden beams. Finally I want them to be at peace as they look up and gaze at the fluidity of the rotation of the wooden beams and watch the shapes and perspectives change as they move around.

(ii) I want the structure to create a sense of welcoming and arrival. As well as a calmness like one might experience from the fluidity of waves.

2. I used parameters to change the amount of spheres as well as their size and their amplitude of the pathway along the sine wave shape. This way I could determine a good size and number that allows students to use them as seats or lean against them. I also importantly considered changing the number of spheres and their spacing so that there is enough room to walk through and around them.

I then used parameters to change the height and distance of the arch to make sure the shape looks appealing, like a rainbow. Then I made sure to change the number of wood beams and the amount of rotations, that way I could replicate the patterns and waves I wanted, so that views from all angles could experience a sense of motion.
