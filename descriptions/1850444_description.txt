This design was created with a simple yet eye-catching concept in mind. The design takes rotated square pillars as the main structure to show a unique aspect to simple structure. Using the lines to create curved “roof” pieces allows the design to have an abstract eye-catcher. The back bench connecting the two sides together is set to be at a height for visitor seating. The hope of this design is for pedestrians and visitors to feel attracted to the sight of the pavilion and hopefully take photos, make friends, and feel a sense of connection to those around feeling the abstract piece around them. With the Week of Welcome in mind, this piece was made to draw attention to new students. With the whimsical structure of the roof and the seating attracting the many wandering students on campus. The design would allow students to make connections when exploring the design, and allow for students to make friends while taking a break and sitting on the bench of the pavilion, building a new community.

While using the parametric tools in Dynamo, I was drawn to the tools that I could use with ease and with definite reasoning. From watching the module videos and exploring how to change parameters to fit with the structure I had in mind, playing with where structures could go and how the code works solidified my choice in the design concept chosen. By figuring out how to move the rotating tiles shown in the example video to be pillars gave me a good grasp on the concept of parameters in Dynamo. The roof lines were also completed after playing with the curves and parameters in Python code.
