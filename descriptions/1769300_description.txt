The Prairie Grove Pavilion brings together the rolling formation of Alberta's prairies and the elegant greenery that defines the University of Alberta and the forests in Canada's national parks. The flowing roof structure was was inspired by the rhythmic motion of the prairie landscapes, while the wooden columns are made from trees that support wildlife across the country, such as bears in Banff national park, and even wildlife like squirrels all across campus. This connection to nature reinforces a sense of grounding and environmental awareness. Simple gold and green benches were added under the pavilion to represent U of A identity, which creates a welcoming place for students to connect. 

The pavilion itself is designed to offer students and anyone on campus an inviting experience during the Week Of Welcome. As students approach, the sweeping roof guides them inside, creating a sense of arrival and belonging. The open structure allows light and wind to move through the spice, while the wood elements provide comfort and contrasts to the activity in the Main Quad. The idea is to create a place where students can gather, meet new individuals, and simply enjoy the atmosphere of the campus. 

Parametric controls were used to get the final shape and form of the pavilion. Adjustable parameters influenced the curvature and flow of the roof, which allows the pavilion to shift between subtle waves to aggressive waves if needed. Sliders were also used for column spacing and beam radius, which changed the rhythm, enclosure, and openness. By exploring and testing different radii, peaks, and more, I changed how movement, light, and structure interacted until the pavilion reflected both the prairie motion and the character of Alberta's landscapes. The final design shows a balance between Alberta's environment, national parks, and the spirit of the University of Alberta community.
