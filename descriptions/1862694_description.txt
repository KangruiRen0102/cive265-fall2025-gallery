The foundation of my pavilion is a 5x5 grid of vertical columns that perfectly occupy the entire 10 m x 10 m footprint, offering impeccable support and design. The roof is a continuous wave that forms a flowing canopy sitting above these columns. During the Week of Welcome, the design aims to give students a strong sense of movement and peace. The excitement and activity of the first week on campus are reflected in the peaks and curvatures that visitors encounter while walking beneath the roof. The wavy roof adds a sense of belonging and visual interest, capturing both structure and flow while the regular grid of columns keeps the design clear and perfectly ordered. The design aims to offer comfort to those who may be overwhelmed by their very first week on campus.

I used a number of Dynamo's parametric controls to creatively improve the pavilion. The column height, each wave height on the roof, the column radius, and the number of columns across the design were all adjusted using sliders. By altering these parameters, I was able to test a wide range of variations of wave heights to make the design more structurally intact and 3d printable while still accounting for maximum visual appeal. I also observed how the 5x5 grid of columns opened the area underneath the roof perfectly and could potentially seat picnic tables underneath to increase the belonging of the design. I experimented with these controls until I found a form that created a welcoming and unforgettable experience for everyone who attends the Week of Welcome, striking a balance between visual comfort and structural integrity.
