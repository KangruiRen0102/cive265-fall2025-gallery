My pavilion was created to be both welcoming and accommodating. It has a smooth ramp up on all sides so that it blends in nicely with the rest of the Quad and can be accessed from all directions, also the ramp makes the pavilion more wheelchair accessible. The roof is there to provide shelter from heat and the sun. It was designed with Week of Welcome in mind for multiple reasons, the obvious one is that it is painted in the University of Alberta’s signature green and gold colors. It is also designed with a raised platform to give new students a sense of accomplishment, everyone can stand on it like a winner on their podium, thus amplifying their achievement of getting into university. There is also the fact that many new university students can find this step up from high school scary, so the simple design of the pavilion is purposeful to avoid overwhelming those students. I used Dynamo’s parametric controls to simplify the creation of the pavilion and save time by creating 2 classes. The first was a cone that I utilized twice to create both the platform and the roof. The second was a column that I was able to use to make a series of instances of columns connecting the cones. By having easily adjustable parameters it was very easy to find the exact dimensions that gave off the impression that I wanted. An example was in finding the best possible radius for the columns so that they don't look dangerously thin, while also not being so thick they become dominating and restrictive. Also the height of the columns can be adjusted with an easy slider in case the University wants to place something taller than expected inside of it.
