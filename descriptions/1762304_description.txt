When considering the theme of my pavilion, I wanted to create something that was just as inviting to look at as Week of Welcome is about inviting new students and staff to the UofA – something that would elicit "ooh"s and "ahh"s and create a sense of awe and curiosity in visitors that pass by. Through the beauty of the pavilion, I also wanted to inspire a sense of pride towards the UofA for having such a beautiful display, and through that pride, help people to integrate with and feel comfortable around the UofA community as a whole – which aligns with the spirit of Week of Welcome. I also wanted the pavilion to correlate with the UofA in some way, which led me to look towards the university mascots – GUBA and Patches – for ideas. It was Patches the Panda in particular who became my biggest inspiration for my pavilion concept: a bamboo forest. With towering green bamboo shoots that immersed the viewer in the setting, and stained glass walls behind them that would filter light passing through, creating a lush and breathtaking backdrop, I hoped to create a pavilion that instilled wonder in those who came up close. Besides being beautiful, this structure could also be utilized to introduce Week of Welcome attendees to the adorable university mascots, as well as bring attention to women’s sports at the UofA. 

To achieve this vision of a bamboo forest, parametric controls helped me to adjust aspects like the height, size, and length of the walls, as well as the height, size, and thickness of the bamboo stalks, in order to best imitate a forest full of tall, majestic bamboo. Through playing around with the parameters and exploring different possibilities for what this pavilion could look like (taller stalks, thinner stalks, taller walls, etc), I came to a final design that was both aesthetically pleasing to look at as a vibrant forest, practically useful as a place to gather with the shade from its tall walls, and aligned with my initial vision for my pavilion.
