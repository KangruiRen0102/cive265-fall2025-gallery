The experience that pedestrians are to take from this pavilion is a safe, welcoming structure for social networking or simply outdoor enjoyment. The thought of a funneling shape is to portray a symbol of "funnel of opportunities" which is appropriate for welcoming new students to the university, embarking their university journey. With such a eccentric structure in the middle of Quad, it will catch the eyes of students, inviting them over to socialize and network with other students. The funnel component of the pavilion acts as a structure, creating shade for occupants to hang out under, especially during the hot weather during the Week of Welcome. During a rainy/snow season, the funnel component can also be utilized to collect rainwater/snow for further use such as irrigation purposes. A cylinder is placed at the base of the funnel, acting as a 360 degree seating area for occupants. The use of parametric controls, such as adjusting the coordinates associated to the arc, making up the funnel shape, allowed me to design an appropriate for aesthetics and functionality. The angle of curve, height of the funnel, and radius of the top of the funnel are adjustable, creating different variations of the funnel to determine the optimized shape for a shelter to openness ratio. The adjustable height of the 360 bench also is incorporated to ensure the base functionality of a seating area but also an aesthetic look in relation to the shape of the funnel.
