The pavilion was designed to present a welcoming feeling upon entering the center of the university. As main quad is at the center it was essential to provide something aesthetically pleasing. The pavilion is not only functions as a welcoming visual but also doubles as creating a space for recreation. It provides shade and shelter while also keeping an open concept to prevent isolation from the rest of the campus. This will aid in providing a sense of community it can be used as a gathering space for events, for instance Week of Welcome events. The pavilion is made of two materials. The columns and square frame will be made of steel while the beams on top will be timber. This gives a pleasant contrasting look upon arrival but also is functional as the steel is the supporting members.
The design within Dynamo provides ability for the variability of the design. There are four number sliders included to be able to control components within the design. The first two sliders can control the height of the pavilion and radius of the four supporting columns. These two controls will give the ability to design the pavilion in such a way that it looks proportional to its surroundings. The other two number sliders consisted of the ability to change the number of timber beams on top of the structural frame and the ability to change the height of both the timber beams and steel structural frame. This variability allows to choose a desirable look for the pavilion but also contribute to things like the generation of shade it provides in a space (the more beams on top can result in more shade).
