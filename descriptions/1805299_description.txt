1. The Constellation Pavilion welcomes new students by connecting them to UofA’s legacy through a floating star canopy. Sturdy columns provide stability and the overall frame of the gazebo, while steel stars above are engraved with names and former faculties of impactful alumni. New students and visitors will be able to see themselves as part of a continuum of excellence during Week of Welcome. The scattered star pattern creates dynamic visual interest as people move through the space, fostering interest in the alumni and inspiration for one’s own legacy. While UofA currently has alumni recognition, such as the wall of engineering graduates near the solarium, most of these are separated by faculty and hidden in obscure areas of campus. In showcasing alumni from different faculties in one place, the idea that excellence is found in all disciplines and the importance of achieving success in different walks of life is reinforced.
2. Both Star_Count_X and Star_Count_Y vary the density of the stars from sparse constellations to a significantly more dense ‘sky of stars’. Amplitude controls the height of the roof, allowing for more intimate low spaces or very dramatic high ceilings, depending on the vibe of the event. Star_Height makes stars "float" at different levels, creating dynamic relationships between fixed structure and movable elements. The stars are able to lower independently of the roof, but will also lower with the roof if ‘Amplitude’ is adjusted. Through using a parametric approach, the Constellation Pavilion serves as both functional and inspirational, making it a perfect addition for UofA’s Week of Welcome.
