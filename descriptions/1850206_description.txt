The Dome of New Beginnings is meant to be a large, eye-catching structure installed in the Main Quad during the Week of Welcome (WOW). Its large, distinct shape is meant to be noticeable, and forms a beautiful addition to the Main Quad for the Week of Welcome. In addition to its appearance, the Dome of New Beginnings serves as a perfect meeting and resting place. It is visible from all around, and the benches inside form a comfortable place to wait / rest. Inside, visitors are able to gaze up at its unique geometry, as well as the natural beauty of the outdoors surrounding it.

Parametric controls were used extensively in the creation of my final design. In the creation of the arched dome shape, I used parametric controls to define most of the adjustable design options, to provide maximum creative flexibility in determining the shape of the final structure. Similarly, all of the dimensions of the benches in the middle are adjustable using parametric controls. Adjusting these parameters to arrive at my final design was a delicate balancing act, combining aesthetics, function, and constructability. If I made the radius of the cylinders in the supporting arches too small, the design would be very challenging to support structurally. But make them too large, and it restricts access inside. Similarly, the number of arches, the radius of the arches, and the overall dimensions are all optimised to provide an open and welcoming pavilion, while also providing a unique and eye-catching geometry, and maintaining structural integrity.
