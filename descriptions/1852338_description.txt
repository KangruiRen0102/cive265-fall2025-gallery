My Pavilion attempts to incorporate multiple important aspects of both the University of Alberta and the province of Alberta as a whole to show all students the qualities of the province and the university. This begins as you look forward towards the truss structure, which supports multiple large plates which are made in a unique way, in which it is a 3-beam / triangular truss with multiple cross beams and median beams at each level, which was made in order to illustrate important aspects to the university. These aspects are the 3 major faculties at the university being research, medicine, and engineering. The inner section of the truss roughly replicates DNA's helical structure, which demonstrates the research and medical aspects of the university, while it being a truss helps demonstrate the engineering aspects of the university. The 4 upper plates are each angled with them being angled from the low side angled towards the north-east and the high side being the south-west side, which is made specifically to help replicate Alberta's topography. Each of the plates also illustrate the 4 important regions of Alberta with their colour. The lower north-east region represents the boreal forest, which inhabits most of the northern areas of the province. The yellow region to the north-west is to represent fertile farmland found throughout the province. The brown portion to the north-east represents the badlands region near Drumheller. Finally, the highest points to the southwest represent the Rocky Mountains with the grey colour. This pavilion helps to represent qualities important to the university and Albertan's as a whole, and could be used in the Week of Welcome to inform possible international or non-local students about these aspects, while also being able to be used for shade on those hot late-summer / early-fall days found in our city.
