My pavilion is designed to not only be simple but also have the presence for the week of WOW. I want pedestrians to not feel overstimulated or intimidated by my pavilion. I want it to have a sense of relaxation and comfort. Somewhere you can sit down, get away from the sun and enjoy a picnic. 
I used parametric controls in many different ways. One of them being changing the height of the pavilion just in case there are height restrictions. Another parametric control I used was being able to change the number of pillars supporting the lattice roof, considering if you wanted to make it look more brutalist. Lastly, I used one to control the design of the lattice roof to make it cooler or again, brutalist. Adjusting these parameters can completely change the look and approach of the pavilion. It can go from open and relaxing to something very intimidating and unapproachable.
