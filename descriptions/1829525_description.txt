The concept of my design is to create a warm and welcoming tunnel that will provide good shade for the students during the week of welcome, to protect from all kinds of weather. The pavilion consists of rhythmic pattern of repeated steel arches. the open sides keep the pavilion airy and breathable pleasing which will in the center of the campus. The curving geometry of the pavilion not only offers protection from the sun and rain but it also conveys a sense of movement and arrival. This pavilion can be used for welcoming social space where students can congregate, meet friends, or participate in activities.

Parametric controls were used to test different shapes and sizes unit it matches the right size that I wanted to use for the pavilion. To do this I used sliders for the arch curvature, steel radius and support height, this allowed me to compare how different variations are. The volume was used using watch nodes to help find the right balance. The parametric systems let me experiment and arrive at the final design which I wanted to create and the projects practical needs.
