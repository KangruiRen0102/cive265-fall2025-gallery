This pavilion is designed for pedestrians to feel a sense of creative freedom. Although the design is quite simple, it is to encourage that there are no limits or restraints to what you want to achieve. It was made since during the Week of Welcome, many students would feel stressed about their first year at university so this pavilion could help them feel more at ease and to be themselves.

My parametric controls in this design were made so that despite the changes made to the elements, the structure would remain recognizable and inviting. This is to represent how no matter what the students experience in university, whether it's good or bad, as long as their goal remains the same, they will succeed.
