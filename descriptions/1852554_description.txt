I chose my pavilion to have this design in order to provide pedestrians a safe place to take a seat because most outside seating on campus is exposed to weather conditions like rain or snow. Therefore, with a roof and benches, most can still enjoy the outdoors while being safe from the weather conditions. Additionally, despite the design having walls to support the roof, it is still a large space to prevent feeling confined. Finally the border from the cylindrical walls and the bench is to provide a temporary shelf for people who decide to stay and relax. Therefore, the overall experience I want pedestrians to have from my pavilion is a sense of relaxation where they can sit and rest, but also somewhere they can connect with their friends while still being outdoors. This reasoning is also relevant during the Week of Welcome, where it is a safe area for small gatherings to occur. As well as a spot to rest away from larger events held in the main quad but still be able to spend time with a small group. 

I used the parametric controls in order to change the height of the roof and border, the border thickness, the depth of the pillars within the pavilion and the radius of the pillars. From exploring the parameters, I chose the height of the roof because it is tall enough to provide a large space, so the pavilion feels less enclosed, but not too high to be overwhelming. After trial and error, the depth and border thickness were chosen in order to still provide a reasonable distance between the benches to still provide a sense of community where individuals would be close to talk to one another but also far enough if individuals only want privacy to rest. Adjusting the height of the border allowed me to choose the perfect height where it was high enough to be used as a temporary shelf, so individuals don't need to place their belongings on the dirty floor. Finally after adjustments, the radius of the pillars was chosen in order to provide the most support for the roof.
