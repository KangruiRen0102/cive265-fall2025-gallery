1. The Glass Arch is designed to be open and welcoming to all, with sweeping glass and steel it uses modern architecture and open design to allow for lots of people to gather. The simple arch expands to allow for minimal ground space use and maximal cover. The smart glass allows for protection from sun on a sunny day or light to come through on a rainy one. The Glass Arch is a welcoming piece of art and function. Having the arch not symmetric allows for one dominated side of events and the other to be less busy. From the ground one would look up at the impressive steal rods and glass cover framing the sky and displaying modern civil and architectural design. The Pavilion would show UofA’s commitment to future technology and innovation. This design evokes an excitement and inspiration for new and returning student during the welcome week. This should be used to bring STEM fields a place to gather and get ready for the new year. This pavilion is a grand center piece of the welcome week set up and could even be a permanent addition to the UofA campus.
2. The paramedic control allowed me to experiment with spacing and overall design. Over this project I had many different ideas and outcome but eventually landed on this design. The Arch could look different in many ways, allowing for it to curve down or removing main arches would change it use. I believe my end designer was a good mix of art and functionality. The simplicity of patters allows for a unique design.
