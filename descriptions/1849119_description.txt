My pavilion design is a sloping tunnel with a parabolic entrance. My main design rationale was to create a space that had a large, welcoming opening at the front and a spacious interior for people to pause and interact. The structure's huge arch opening creates a sense of welcome and invitation and is great for a large number of students moving in and out of the pavilion, this is crucial for the Week of Welcome as it compensates for the volume of students and helps students feel comfortable and welcomed as they enter the campus. I also wanted to create a sense of community, which was achieved by creating a large space inside the pavilion for students to relax and interact with one another without feeling cramped. To further the sense of community, I wanted to create a pavilion that represented the university in some way; I ended up drawing inspiration from the university's mascot, the Golden Bear. This is what led me to the sloping tunnel design, which represents a bear's den.

I used the parametric controls to explore different design possibilities such as the arch height, beam thickness, and density, as well as the glass thickness. I used number sliders to control the design characteristics, these characteristics best aligned with my design rationale and purpose, as they controlled the spatial and visual elements that were essential for creating the sense of welcoming and community. Adjusting these parameters was critical to refine the design, adjusting the arch height was important to maximize internal space and create a well-sized gathering area. On the other hand, making the arch too tall would create an unrealistic and awkward-looking arch and would be unrealistic to design and construct. Adjusting the beam density and thickness was for refining the aesthetics of the pavilion, creating a visually pleasing grid design that would not hinder the size of the gathering area.
