The pavilion is designed as an inviting, sculptural gathering point that enhances the sense of arrival during the University of Alberta’s Week of Welcome. Its form expresses comfort, playfulness, and community. The broad canopy creates a distinct visual identity while offering functional shade, giving pedestrians a welcoming moment of pause as they enter campus. The central sunken flower pot, when utilized, reinforces themes of growth and renewal, symbolizing the beginning of the academic year and connecting the pavilion to the natural environment.

The user experience emphasizes relaxation and social interaction. The seating platform’s soft, petal-like geometry provides multiple places to sit, encouraging both group gathering and quiet individual use. The twisting steel rods were shaped to evoke movement and interconnectedness; they visually pull the ground plane upward to support the glulam roof shell, creating a continuous flow that feels both structural and expressive. The layered wavy roof geometry introduces a sense of rhythm and softness, reducing the scale of the canopy and creating a comfortable, human-scaled enclosure beneath it.

Parametric controls were essential in developing the pavilion’s final form. Adjustable sliders allowed systematic exploration of roof height, peak roof amplitude, radius, rod twist, and seat height. Increasing or reducing the roof amplitude changes the mood beneath the canopy, ranging from calm and subtle, to energetic and sculptural. Varying the rod twist affected how dynamic or stable the structure appears, while adjusting the roof radius changes how open or intimate the space feels. These parameters enables rapid iteration to achieve a balance between visual expressiveness, spatial comfort, and structural clarity. Through this parametric process, the design has evolved into a pavilion that is both welcoming and memorable, supporting the Week of Welcome’s goals of creating community-oriented spaces.
