Design Concept and User Experience
This pavilion is designed to give students a simple, comfortable place to stop and rest during the Week of Welcome. I made the structure from many repeated cylinders that form two walls and a sloped roof by two different panel combined. This creates shade and lets light pass through in a soft way, making the space feel open but still sheltered. The wall on the right side has a circular hole, which allows people to look through it, take pictures, or interact with the pavilion in a fun way. The sloped front wall helps guide people into the space under the roof. Overall, the pavilion creates a small, welcoming area where visitors can pause, meet friends, or escape the busy atmosphere of the Quad for a moment.
Parametric Controls
The design is controlled by four main parameters. The cylinder radius slider changes how thick each cylinder is, which affects how solid or light the pavilion looks. The hole radius slider changes the size of the circular opening in the right wall. This lets the hole act either as a small window or a large feature depending on the value. The vertical offset slider moves the hole up or down, allowing the opening to match eye height or sit lower or higher depending on the design. The horizontal offset slider moves the hole left or right across the wall, changing the balance and appearance of the pavilion. By adjusting these parameters, I was able to test many versions of the design and choose a final shape that feels simple, clear, and inviting for students during Week of Welcome.
