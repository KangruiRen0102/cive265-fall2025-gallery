(i) I wanted the pavilion to function as a large and open semi-sheltered gathering space. The bright yellow legs and opening arches draw attention to the structure while the green strips provide shade. I also wanted to make the pavilion stand out and function as an icon of the school hence the mascot colours. I want people to think about the tent when they think about the University of Alberta. For pedestrians the pavilion also functions as a central and iconic meeting space for people unfamiliar with the campus. Someone could say “lets meet at the tent” and the other party would instantly know what they are talking about

(ii) In consideration of the week of welcome I wanted to make a tent design as it would correspond with the Basecamp program creating a sense of shelter and community. The pavilion would serve as an open area where Basecamp participants could meet and activities would take place. Since first years are unfamiliar with the campus during the week of welcome, the pavilion also functions as a simple meeting place or beacon to help them orient themselves among the seemingly identical maze of brick and glass buildings since they are already familiar with it.


I first explored different possibilities with parametric controls by connecting a straight line from each foot to the peak and then connecting a number slider to a Curve.PointAtParameter node in order to adjust where the leg will bend to form a curve. Then I used another number slider connected to a Geometry.Translate node’s z-input to lift that point off the line to create a 3-point arc. I also used a slider to control the height of the pavilion/middle support and another for the height of the opening arches. I then adjusted these parameters until the desired shape of the ‘tent’ was reached. I did this while keeping head room in mind as well as walkability as users can walk in and out from any side of the pavilion.
