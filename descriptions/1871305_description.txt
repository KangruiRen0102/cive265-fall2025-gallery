I designed this pavilion with a simple presentation in mind, while also being able to provide pedestrians with adequate shelter during the week of welcome. Since it takes place when the weather is at its best in Edmonton, low temperatures and snow is not a concern when considering the design. The overall design of the pavilion aims to create a sense of simplicity, which represents the school’s atmosphere and ensures that new students feel welcome and are reassured in experiencing an exiting but scary new chapter in life. The single tall standing steel beam is a representation of unity in the school, and how when working together as one, we can hold up many pillars that may be falling, no matter how heavy.

I used parametric controls to adjust the scale and grandness of the pavilion, while also being able to adjust the effectiveness of the shelter that it can provide. Eventually, I settled on a balance of beautiful visuals while providing enough shelter for its users. The radius of the wooden rods and volume of the steel beam was chosen to be thin, but not too thin where they become difficult to see and borderline useless. The height of the steel beam and wooden rods attached was chosen to be on the lower side to not overwhelm the students and help create a cozier atmosphere. The length of the wooden rods from the steel beam to the ground was also chosen for this reason. The spread of the wooden rods was chosen to be close enough to one another that they provide shelter, while also creating a sense of belonging together.
