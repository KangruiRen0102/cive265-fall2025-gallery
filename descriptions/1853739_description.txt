The Meeting Matrix offers a visually appealing pavilion that promotes users to socialize. The open ended design of the pavilion allows the users to be able to enter from the two open ends and between the beams. To continue, placed between the beams are benches that are accessible from either side of the pavilion to encourage larger student interactions. 

The purpose of the Meeting Matrix is to attract students to be able to hang out and meet new people. The design concept provides a sense of belonging without feeling restricted.

By allowing for the adjustment of the curve in the top beams, paired with the bench width and height, it encourages the alteration of the design based on personal preferences. On the other hand, the slider for the bench length is variable to allow for a different amount of people able to sit on each bench.
