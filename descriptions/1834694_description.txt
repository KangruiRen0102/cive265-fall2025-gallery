The Slated Teepee of Welcoming aims to create the experience of community gathering, joy, and excitement for the new and returning students and faculty for the academic year. 

The 8 pillars (which can be dynamically changed) symbolizes that the university sits on Treaty 8 territory; The Teepee bridges Indigenous elements via its design. 

The Teepee of Welcoming encourages gathering through its open-air design. Its slanted design encourages groups to face each other to chat, have fun, and make friends: what week of welcoming is all about. The Teepee design specifically for the Week of Welcome aims to recognize that UofA sits on indigenous land. The slated shading panels occupy one side of the Teepee, blocking the suns impact, leaving the rest of the openings free for individuals to enter. 

- Slanted Teepee design based off indigenous history through its 8 pillars, symbolizing the university sits on Treaty 8 Territory. Changing the number of pillar parameters to 6, 7 or 8 arrives at the other treaties. Decreasing the pillars makes the pavilion more open, increasing the pillars enables the pavilion to block more light; creating more shade, encouraging people to gather to escape harsh light. 

- Parametric open rooftop allows for different size holes to emit amount of light/shade. The rationale & purpose is to limit the amount of light, encouraging people who have never interacted before, to interact through a place of shade.

- Parametric height controls enables the Teepee to be as big or small as the one wants to develop it. A larger Teepee enables individuals to see it from afar and thus making it easy to find; encouraging people to gather.

- The slate shading shields participants from the sun. Parameterization controls slate number and thickness. Through its shading it invites community members to enter the Teepee to escape the sun, thus encouraging people to interact with one another through their mutual goal of avoiding the sun.
