The design I chose was based on a wavy cylinder, mimicking a sin or cos function. The design consists of several timber arches of different heights supported by thin steel beams at the top, to insure the stability of the structure. The wavy design gives a slightly futuristic feel, while the choice of timber as the main material keeps the structure warm and welcoming. The spacing of the arches allows for light to enter the structure, and keeps the structure bright and airy on the inside, so that the pedestrians do not feel constricted. As students walk through the pavilion, the rhythmic rise and fall of the arches creates a shifting visual experience, drawing their eyes upward and forward. It is designed to be an immersive corridor that transforms a simple walk across the grass into an engaging event. The design is meant to induce an air of excitement and awe in the new student, the intriguing design captivating the viewer.
In order to arrive at the final design, I used 4 sliders in order to adjust key parameters easily, allowing the exploration of several versions of the design. The number of arches slider allowed for the adjustment of the density of the structure, allowing me to find a balance between shelter and openness. Too little arches felt sparse and disconnected, too many arches created a dense tunnel which limited visibility. However the more arches the more smooth the design appeared, creating more points for the wave. In the end I opted for a more dense structure, sacrificing some openness for improved aesthetics. The amplitude parameter allowed for experimentation of the roof design, adjusting how drastic the waves would be. A low amplitude felt static and boxy, so I opted for a higher amplitude in order to create an intriguing design and match my design rationale of ‘excitement'. Lastly, I included dimension parameters in order to ensure the design was grand enough to accommodate large groups of students, while staying within the designated zone.
