When I created this design, I wanted to base my design around a bench in order to provide incoming students a place to sit and socialize during the Week of Welcome. Having a centralized bench allows pedestrians a place to rest and a place to do homework in a centralized area (main quad) between classes. Besides this, the main goal behind this pavilion and behind the circular design of the bench and structure is to create an area conducive to people interacting with each other. Especially during the Week of Welcome, when many new students arrive and want to form connections with others, this pavilion can allow those who sit there to interact with each other by the nature of being forced to face others when sitting on the bench. Pedestrians should be able to interact with others at this pavilion because, in a new environment, especially with the size of the UofA, it is difficult to make new connections and interact with others in a meaningful way. By designing this pavilion around a bench which allows people to face others and to be in a closed and small area, those who may not be comfortable interacting with others can become more confident and can make new friends during the Week of Welcome.

The design of this pavilion is largely based on parametric controls in terms of the thickness of the metal beams, the width of the pavilion, the height of the bench, the height of the structure, the number of metal beams, and the shape of the metal beams. Seeing as the purpose of this structure is to provide a space for new students to meet others, I adjusted the height of the bench to raise it to a height which will be comfortable for most to sit on. While the width of the structure may be too large to allow for students to have intimate conversations, its size gives the pavilion more functions, such as a place to rest or complete homework. The other parameters were adjusted such that the columns allowed for seating space and the top structure looked nice.
