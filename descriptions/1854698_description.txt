The Sine Wave. Oscillations and waves could categorize our everyday feelings, or events in our lives. With contrast to math, interpretation of the sine wave to real life can be abstract. The sine function describes the behaviour of everything in the world, what we see, such as light waves, sound waves, and other waves periodically. In the Week of Welcome, new students are given the opportunity to go through a rigorous, lengthy but not harmful, long list of events to be introduced and possibly integrate themselves within the campus, community and university. Like how sine waves visualize light waves, the waves that allow us to see, the Wave of Welcome visualizes the ups-and-downs that a big transition in life offers, but most importantly the on-going and everlasting flow of students and growth of academia. 
In the structure, it is composed of the wave and the steel rod. The overall wave provides a place for students and pedestrians to sit, relax and study. The steel rod is there for foundational support. If the Wave is the flow of academia, then the Steel Rod is the commitment of students, staff and professors to contribute and continue the everlasting growth.

Of the seven sliders in my project, none of them pose extreme significance relative to design rationale and purpose. But some significance can be seen. Interpretation of this could be, for example, a large amplitude of the wave to be a week of welcome with high number of newly admitted students, or a large steel rod radius to represent student solidarity with professors against the University. For direct purpose of sliders, those include:
- Amplitude of Wave = Visual Prominence
- Z-offset = Adjusts to amplitude to keep wave above ground
- Centering = Adjusts to length to keep wave on plot of land (10,000 x 10,000)
- Steel Rod Radius = Dependent on how big the rod needed to structurally support wave
- Rib Count & Rib Width = Density and “Openness” control
- Length = Adjusts length of wave on y-axis
