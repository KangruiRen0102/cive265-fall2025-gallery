“The RibCage” 

The pavilion acts as a “gateway” into the university. The repeating structures create a “tunnel” effect which further emphasises the transition into the academic world of university. Poetically, the name “RibCage” comes from the idea that as people stand inside the pavilion, they represent the heart which keeps the university alive. It also acts as a modified shelter. During the week of welcome the only tents for students are filled and crowded which can be overwhelming for some individuals. The gaps in the RibCage allow for a design that does not feel claustrophobic. 

The use of sliders can change the thickness of the cylinders used. By adjusting the thickness, we can make a design that allows for more gaps within the pavilion, which can allow for more air to enter. In contrast, the sliders can reduce the gaps between cylinders and create a more sheltered pavilion, if so desired.
