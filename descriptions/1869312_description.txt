I call my project "The Hive Dome", and the point was to make a something that looks exactly like a giant hive to match the UofA Golden Bears spirit and provide essential shade relief during WOW. To create the hive shape I wanted, I set points and connected them into a line, then revolved the line by 360 degrees. Than using a python node, I spilt the surface of the Hive shape (base shape) into a grid. Than using the surface points i created a normal for it and drew circles that were normalized to the surface. This allowed me to create the dome pattern. However since i wanted honey comb shapes, i added an extra node to allow for shapes in the circle to be changed with number of edges. (Triangles, squares, and hexagons!). With this base shape i was able to create the perfect dome shape. However, the restrictions of the assignment caused me to create an extra pillar base, which were mainly using concepts from the example videos. Finally to complete the dome. I created some extra shapes to extrude for entrance, a top hole, and remove any excess that went through the base plate. Additionally, I added some color to really differentiate the materials of the base and the dome.
