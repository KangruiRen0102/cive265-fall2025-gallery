For the Week of Welcome, I designed a pavilion shaped like the Alberta wild rose, the province’s official flower. I wanted to make something that really feels true to Alberta and the land we are on, since students from all around Canada and other parts of the world come to University of Alberta with big dreams. The wild rose represents the blooming future of the students trying to achieve their dreams. As pedestrians go by, I want them to feel excited and encouraged to look forward to spring, as spring always comes after the cold and harsh winter so they should not give up. 
I used parametric controls to adjust the height of the flower and also the length of the petals. I wanted to make large petals so they can provide good shade and also look pleasing to the eyes, no matter what the weather is. The height of the wooden support that I chose was reasonably tall to be more inclusive to people with any height. Combining both the height and length, the pavilion felt more welcoming and inclusive. I also added a parametric control for the number of petals in the pavilion. I wanted the flower to look as close as the actual flower, so making only 5 petals helped me keep petals with a good width to provide shade and align with my idea. The petals are arched higher than the edges to give it a more bloomed appearance like the actual flower which makes it feel fresh spring. Adjusting the parameters helped me refine the pavilion’s overall design by making it look more like the Alberta wild flower and make it feel welcoming.
