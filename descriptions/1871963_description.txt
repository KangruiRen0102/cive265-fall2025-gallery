The overlapping green and gold roof flaps are to symbolize the coming together of the university's staff and students. This will create a sense of support and comfort for students who are away from their home and families. For a lot of students leaving home, the university should make it a number one priority to make sure the students enjoy their university experience. Making a reference to the engineering prowess of the university, the outer crossmembers and gussets symbolize the strong foundation of support for all students. Once again these are colored in the true green and gold fashion to keep on the theme of the university. During the week of welcome the weather is quite warm, so this structure will also provide shade so students stay cool.

For the design of rotational symmetry, I chose to make sure that the number of roof flaps match the number of crossmembers by basing the start and end of the poly lines off of the endpoints of the crossmembers. The number of crossmembers also dictates the amount of gussets which will make the overall design appearance seem more dense or less dense depending on how many the designer chooses. If the designer chooses fewer gussets, students might feel more comfortable with entering the structure from any direction. This will symbolize that everyone is on a different path in this university experience. Keeping with the continuity of the design, I wanted to make sure that the height of the center rings and center post matched the height of the end points of the flaps to ensure the structural integrity of the design. To find the balance between the number of crossmembers and gussets to ensure the students have multiple access points along with production and support from the roof will make this structure appealing to new students during the week of welcome.
