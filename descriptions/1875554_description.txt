The design concept for the pavilion that I had created was to illustrate the beauty of simplicity, how not much is needed to create something memorable and striking, with the hope that users will see the space as a meeting ground to discuss ideas, take shelter from the sun or as a spot to simply hang around. Considering the context of the Week of Welcome, I hope that the structure promotes a sense of community and belonging, to comfort students who may view themselves as outclassed by their peers or unprepared for what's to come by showing that if simple structures dominate the university of Alberta's main courtyard, then they too belong at this institution. 
During the creation of the pavilion, many different designs were attempted with different parameters around them. For example, at first I tried to design a wavy roof supported by cylinders that were separated by a radius like outline, each cylinder being 90 degrees away from each other based off of the center point. I however decided that this didn’t meet up with the feeling I wanted to create, and therefore that design was scrapped. Then after further adjustment, I arrived at the current design as shown here, with the cylinders spaced out in a square like formation. Configurations such as the ability to adjust the distances between each cylinder along with their heights, allowed me to experiment and create an even better design. Other aspects of the adjustable design parameters also increased my designs potential, as adjusting the frequency, amplitude and number of points on the roof showed how varied a possible design could be. For example, if I make the frequency extreme it will have a more aggressive expression, compared to a lower frequency which will give off a much calmer feeling. Therefore I went with the calmer version as I wish to comfort the new students arriving at the university and enhance their Week of Welcome.
