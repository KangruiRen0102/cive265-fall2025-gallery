"The wave of encounters" is not simply a design that is meant for shelter, but it is also a means of letting students easily interact with one another in an exciting setting. The structure is composed of a series of timber arches that look like waves, and the design was intentionally made to mimic a tunnel, to ensure that students can walk through the tunnel in order to increase the chance of interactions. For this design, I utilized 4 primary parametric controls, The "number of arches" was used to allow the density of the pavilion to be changed, for my design, I chose a higher density, because this will allow for more shelter. The "wave factor" allows you to change how much you want the roof to go up or down, the "arch span" ensures the pavilion can fit in the 10mx10m plot of land, the "arch span" is quite large in my design to maximize the amount of people in the pavilion, and the "max height" allows you to control the peak height of the pavilion. Furthermore, python classes were used to define the timber arch, steel rod and the baserunner components.
