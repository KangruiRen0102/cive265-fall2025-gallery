The Lilypad Cove Pavilion is a tunnel that symbolizes the career and life of a university student. It is made out of plates that are connected by a pipe and these pipes and plates mean something symbolic. The plates represent the struggles you go through university, while the pipe simply means the people around you supporting you throughout a student's university career. To a student coming during week of welcome, this is not what it means to them. It is a great pavilion designed for shelter, comfort, and a great photo spot for them. You are able to climb the top (WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF THEY FALL) to take great photos and see the entirety of the quad. Design wise, you are able to control almost everything from the software. You can change the amount of plates, increase the radius of the plates, change the thickness of the plates, change the radius of the pipe, and change the height of the entire pavilion.
