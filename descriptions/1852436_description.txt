My pavilion opens those who enter into a state of natural excitement with the many opportunities to come. The design consists of a steel pole frame, standing at a height of 9 meters, providing structure and stability outlining the general shape. From here concrete foundation, blocks are placed on the left and right back side providing a strong and sturdy base. Where then a series of vertical wood logs are extended out on top of the foundation which then connect to another series of wood logs branching towards the highest steel beam. Nearing the entrance, more wood logs are placed connecting the ground to the slanted steel pole adding emphasis to the entrance as well as the size of the pavilion. The high quantity of wood logs provide a natural, warm aspect to those who view. Looking at the general shape of the pavilion it consists of a mountain like shape; standing tall and sturdy. With this design I want pedestrians to feel a natural excitement welcoming them to a place which can provide a mountain of opportunities as they enter. Additionally, providing partial shelter from sun or rain due to the slatted design. This design would be perfect for the Week of Welcome as at the entrance you stand at the base of the mountain where throughout your time spent at the University of Alberta you will climb a mountain, reaching the peak and completing the journey. This provides a sense of arrival knowing you made it to the base bringing excitement for what's to come. While designing this I explored many ways to use parametric controls to model many different shapes and designs. For example, using series to save time on placing many objects in repetition. Or using slats instead of walls to not cause a sense of confinement where I then adjusted the shapes and parameters to better fit the feel I want to present in one who enters. And through many trials and many errors I came to my final design giving those who enter "A Warm Welcome to a Mountain of Opportunities".
