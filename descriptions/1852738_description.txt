The "Four Winds Canopy" is a timber-and-steel pavilion that represents unity and diversity. It was inspired by the idea of people, including my friends and me, coming from all directions of the world to learn, grow, and find community. Four steel ribs symbolize the four world directions and the different paths students take before converging at the university. A central cylinder represents the university as a place of knowledge and belonging. Timber slats form an umbrella-like canopy that provides shade and symbolizes protection and inclusion. The outer ring represents the wider world, while the inner ring marks the transition into a shared community. During the Week of Welcome, the pavilion offers shade, comfort, and a natural meeting place where new students can relax, connect, and feel part of campus from day one.

Parametric controls helped me quickly test and adjust the pavilion’s shape. By using sliders for the slats, rings, ribs, and central column, I could change their size, spacing, and height to see how each version affected shade, openness, and the overall look of the canopy. This made it easy to explore many options and find a design that fits the idea of people coming together from different directions. Adjusting parameters also helped me balance the structure, ensuring the ribs, rings, and slats worked together visually and structurally. Overall, the parametric setup enabled me to refine the pavilion’s form quickly, flexibly, and meaningfully.
