The basis of the design based in part a combination of both a powerplant water-cooling tower but also a tee pee from first nations in addition to it’s large and bold design. It is mean to at first imposing but gradual draw people in with a sense of wonder it is a statement of humanities ability to build structures but also have it so that it can be used by others. The wood inner structure in brownish orange represents the call back to nature being the hidden structure that hold all of man and is the origin of and the sense that human kind has arrived at point of both surpassing humanity and from the pedestrians view that humanities limit to build is the sky the limit itself with the small circular opening withing the pavilion that is made of steel and is the primary material for the pavilion. There also the possibility of putting a small meter by meter fire pit within the design where the reference human person in is which is a rectangle with approximately 1.8 meters and height and 1 meter in width and length and the colour. In general it can be though of as a urban shelter and provide shelter against light rain and foster interaction.
The usage parametric controls were critical in order adjust the size and orientation and the ability to orient the supporting trusses and structures. This allowed for me to adjust the height of the pavilion to allow for more space of pedestrians and adjust the space so that it could be filled properly have adjustment made to the conical like roof be done quickly including the thickness of the walls to reduce the volume of the building to allow possibility to adjust for cost. Without parametric controls it’s more difficult to adjust the structure for the size of the user. With the ability to automatically calculate volume with it being 135,0124,074.04 mm^3 off both wood and steel.
