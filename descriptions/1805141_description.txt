For my Week of Welcome design project, I have created the "Harmonic Pavilion". This serves as a gathering point in main quad where friends who haven't seen each other in months can finally laugh together without the sun blinding them. My goal was to create a community and excitement for new and old students. I chose a sine-wave shape that rises and falls to create distinct zones. The higher, more open side creates a sense of arrival, while the lower roof provides more shade and serves as a cozy hangout spot. The layout uses an open grid of timber posts, which allows students to wander in from any direction, whether they are coming from their long class in CCIS, or if they are coming from eating lunch in SUB. 

To achieve this, I wrote a python script in Dynamo defining the Timberpost and Roofpanel classes. I used four parametric sliders to explore different forms. I adjusted the grid count sliders to ensure the space between the beams was wide enough for groups of students to walk through comfortably. To add onto that, I tuned the wave amplitude to create the dramatic curve of of the roof, balancing the need for shade with open visibility.
