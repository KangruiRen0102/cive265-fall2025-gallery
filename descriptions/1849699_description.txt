In this design, I wanted to create a pavilion that felt open and connected with its surroundings. For this reason, the base and supports leave a large amount of space, allowing people to walk freely throughout the structure. The design's open space prevents a sense of isolation by allowing visibility of the whole quad while experiencing the structure itself. 

To arrive at the desired outcome, I used parameters to adjust the volume and spacing of the support columns. With this effort, I arrived at a value that maintained aesthetics and openness in the design. I also used parameters to adjust the height of the cone roof, finding a proportion between the top and bottom halves that seemed suitable for the design.
