The Pavilion of Future and Past is designed in such a way so as to artfully meld the storied history of the University of Alberta's past with the forward-looking spirit of innovation that guides it today as it enters the future. The design follows the style of stripped classicism, an architectural style which uses the iconic columns and pointed roofs of greco-roman architecture—so-heralded as the foundation of western civilization—but strips it of the intricate and complex details of the time, bringing greco-roman architecture in line with the minimalist design philosophies of modernism.

This exact design uses a sandstone-coloured concrete for its columns and base, eluding to the colours and textures of the University's older buildings, namely the Convocation Hall and the older University Commons. It's columns also offer a great place to lean on, giving some respite from the walking, and its base can act as a sitting place away from the grass, as well as having the possibility for housing commemorative benches to honour important people of the university. Meanwhile, its glass roof shelters its users from the rain and snow, giving them protection while not being too claustrophobic. It also represents the future, the glass invoking ideas of progress and modernity and allowing students to look up to the skies, symbolizing the dream of changing the world and metaphorically telling them that "sky's the limit." 

Overall, I believe that the Pavilion of Future and Past sends a powerful message of what the University of Alberta is, while still leaving room to be a welcoming sight and encouraging students to be free to do anything that they wish, values that I believe should embody the University of Alberta, seeking the truths yet to found in the future while remembering the truth of the past.
