My design is a sundial, both practical and architecturally pleasing. The main purpose of the sundial is to act as not only a way to tell time, but also it can be used as a landmark for students to meet up with their peers. When designing the sundial, there were 3 main elements to consider: the concrete base, the dial that reflects the sun, and the counting rods. To make the counting rods, I chose to use a Python class and instance that created a series of circular rods with spheres on the ends of them. This process made more sense than individually placing each rod and sphere. The second Python class and instance were used to create the cubic base and to ensure that it sat above the ground level. I found it easiest to make the dial with shape blocks so I could manually change how it looked depending on the desired height. 

The Sundial sits on a rectangular base with a cylindrical platform on top of the base; both of these elements are made of concrete for structural rigidity. Within the concrete cylinder, 13 brass rods are sticking out to be used as time markers for the sundial. (A sundial needs 13 time points, not 12 like a standard clock). Then there is a final brass rod used as the dial to cast a shadow on the platform to tell people in the main quad the time. Brass was the chosen material for the dial and time points because it is a good contrast colour to the grey concrete when it is brass in colour, and when it weathers to green.
