I wanted to have an open-concept pavilion where students could have a welcoming experience and not feel confined. I also wanted students to see the trusses at work supporting the roof to give them an idea of engineering at the University of Alberta. Unfortunately my design is quite incomplete and I couldn't get a roof on it. This experience would give them a first impression of the faculty of engineering and inspire any future structural engineers, and the open concept would also give the students a sense of peace and relaxation in the shade away from the busy Quad during week of welcome. 
The parameters I created, such as the height and thickness of the posts, help achieve my rationale by giving flexibility. Being able to choose a comfortable height without being too claustrophobic is important, as well as choosing a secure radius for the posts without being too overbearing. The parameter for the number of trusses also factors in to accommodate the number of posts.
