Design Concept and User Experience

The Golden Bear Courtyard was designed to be a welcoming space that makes people passing by want to stop and enjoy the space. The pavilion is a simple but unique structure with a slanted roof made of multiple steel rods and an area with tables underneath that encourages pedestrians to stop and spend time in the space.

In the context of the Week of Welcome, this pavilion is a place for students to come enjoy their first week on campus sheltered from sun or rain. The tables will encourage students to socialize and meet new people. 


Parametric Controls

Parametric controls allowed me to make adjustments to different parts of my pavilion design including column spacing, roof overhang, the number of roof rods, roof slope as well as the table height. The parametric controls let me see different versions of my pavilion design quickly and easily, helping to see what was best aesthetically and functionally. For example, the table heights could easily be adjusted to be for seating or standing and the number of roof rods can be modified depending on the look you want. Overall, having the parametric controls let me visualize and evaluate my design to ultimately end up with my final design that is The Golden Bear Courtyard.
