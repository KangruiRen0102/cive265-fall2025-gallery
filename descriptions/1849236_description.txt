The idea behind my design was that I wanted something that would stand out in quad. The building around quad are very traditional with their brick exteriors and columns, so to counteract this I went with a modern design. The walls and roof of the pavilion would be made of glass, and have steel bars as a border to the design. To ensure its functionality, I added benches that would also be made of steel to maintain cohesiveness. I liked the idea of using glass so that sunlight could go through and lighten up the space. During week of welcome, there's many activities happening outside along with many students, so it was important to me that those factors remained visible. Furthermore, I think greenery adds character to any design, so the choice of glass allowed me to use the natural environment around quad to it's fullest potential. Lastly, In case of a rainy day, the angular roof will allow the rainwater to slide off into the grass, ensuring the integrity of the structure as water won't pool on top.

I integrated multiple sliders for each roof (width, length, and height independently for the back/front sides, roof thickness), along with the thickness of the walls, and the distance from origin for each half of the structure. At first, I didn't know if I wanted the two halves to sit symmetrically or not, and how far apart to place the benches; using sliders helped me view many different configurations to the foundation of the design. I also wasn't sure what dimensions would work best, so adjusting the sliders aided me in proportions I think suit the design. Getting to explore different looks using my parametric controls allowed to fulfill my original design concept: a simple, bright, modern pavilion that stands out amongst the historical buildings surrounding quad.
