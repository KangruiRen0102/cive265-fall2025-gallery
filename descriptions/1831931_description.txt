1. My concept aims to create feelings of wonder and exploration as you approach and walk through. As people walk through the columns it should feel as though they are discovering and they might meet a new person around every corner. The wave pattern of the metal panels creates a feeling of movement and the wooden columns are almost like a forest when you're inside. The varied height of the panels also creates different vibes within the pavilion with the higher parts feeling more open and free while the low parts are more intimate and close which can be good places for groups of people to socialize. I hope my design will create a sense of community and relaxation for week of welcome with these design choices. 

2. The parametric controls I included in my design are: 
-Number of wooden columns in each direction
-wave shape
-minimum column height 
-maximum column height
-width of metal panels
-thickness of metal panels
-radius of wooden columns

I used my parameters to adjust my design to reflect all of the feelings I wanted to create. I have a fewer number of columns and narrower radius of them to make the space more open for more people to gather, I adjusted the column heights to have a range of high and low to create the different environments within the structure, I chose a smooth wave shape rather than more angular because the smooth easy feeling is what I'm trying to convey, finally I adjusted the width of the metal panels to provide lots of shade within the structure while also letting in sunlight through the gaps to illuminate the space within with a grid pattern.
