The Fold of Encounters is a parametric pavilion created to welcome students into the Week of Welcome by giving them a natural place to gather, move through, and explore. The form rises gently from the ground and curves overhead, almost like it is inviting people to walk underneath it. As you move through the space, the changing heights and shifting curves open up new views of the Quad, making the walk feel like an arrival rather than just a transition. The pavilion stays open on all sides so the flow of people feels easy and relaxed, while the layered ribs add just enough definition to feel intentional without ever making the space feel closed off. It fits the celebratory, social atmosphere of WOW without overwhelming it.

The design starts with a simple lofted surface that is then overlaid with a grid of steel rods. Four main parameters guide how the pavilion behaves: the U and V grid densities that shape the pattern on the surface, the thickness of the glass panel, and the radius of the steel rods. Changing any of these instantly affects the overall character. A tighter grid creates more shade and a more defined structure, while a looser grid opens the form and gives it a lighter, more airy feeling. Every time a parameter shifts, the entire pavilion updates automatically so the geometry always stays clean and consistent.

Two Python classes manage how the materials are actually generated. GlassSurface thickens the lofted form into a real glass panel and calculates its volume. SteelRod follows each rib curve and creates the circular steel profiles that form the frame. Their instance scripts generate full sets of rods and panels, which makes accurate material take-offs possible. As the sliders change, all quantities, rods, panels, and volumes refresh in real time, allowing the design to stay both visually interesting and structurally feasible as it develops.
