1.The Pavilion is designed to look like a mountain range from afar, I think mountains are beautiful and bring a sense of calm and stability. I wanted the pavilion to reflect these characteristics to remind students that life is beautiful and that they can take a break to find their calm and stability during stressful times like the first week of school or settling into a new and unfamiliar place. 
2. I used parameters to control the radius of the timber rods, these rods act as the "roof" so by changing the radius you change the amount of sunlight allowed into/through the pavilion. For example, increasing the radius would decrease the distance between the rods allowing less light to come between the rods. I also used parameters to control the width and depth of the steel support beams, so if the supports needed to be smaller or larger for better support they can easily be altered. last I used parameters to adjust the radius of the steel support rods used to secure the timber rods, by adjusting the radius you can ensure the timber rod ends are covered/secured in place.
