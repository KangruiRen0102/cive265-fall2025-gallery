The OctaShade Pavilion is a lightweight, modular gathering structure designed for the UAlberta Quad and inspired by the idea of open, welcoming geometry. The form is based on an octagonal plan, chosen for its ability to provide enclosure while maintaining visual openness. Eight evenly spaced support columns define the footprint and create a clear relationship between the pavilion and the surrounding landscape. Above them, a faceted roof surface frames a central opening, allowing natural light to filter through and encouraging an inviting atmosphere beneath the canopy.

The geometry is fully parametric. Four primary sliders control the pavilion’s proportions: the number of roof facets, column height, roof pitch, and panel thickness. Adjusting these parameters seamlessly reshapes the roof form and scale, enabling exploration of different spatial qualities while keeping the structure within the required 10 m × 10 m footprint. This parametric flexibility helps maintain balance between shading performance, structural appearance, and user experience.

Two Python classes were implemented to generate and analyze material components. The RodComponent class defines the cylindrical columns and computes their material volume, while the PanelComponent class generates the roof panels and calculates their corresponding volume. Both material quantities are displayed through Watch nodes, ensuring transparency and traceability in the design workflow.

Overall, the OctaShade Pavilion provides a simple but expressive geometric canopy suitable for temporary gathering, shade, and circulation during the Week of Welcome. Its clean form, adaptability, and efficient material logic demonstrate how parameter-driven design can produce functional and visually coherent architectural structures.
