The design of this pavilion is intended to create a sense of movement. During the week of welcome students are coming in from all over the world and experiencing things they have never felt before. With the repeating triangles and the sense of opens of this pavilion it gives of a light feel which invites these new students into there new university life. The pavilion is deigned to flow and to be pleasing to look at, having the curvature and a rhythmic design which invites a feeling of comfort when walking by. Another intention design feature of the pavilion is the openness of it. Having the gaps within the structure lets light in from all directions which invites students walking from any direction to come take a look and having people share the same feeling of community when gathering around. Due to the location of this structure it can also act as a landmark for meetings or events. The parameters of the pavilion were carefully selected to maximize the feeling of comfort. Having a more gentle incline creates a smooth feel as students are easing into there new life. Having tighter spacing allows for a very interesting shade pattern to be produced which draws students in to take a closer look. Having the thickness of the structure be relatively thin creates a light feel which is more uplifting rather then a thick heavy structure that could remind them more of engineering(scary) rather then the intended atmosphere we wanted. The parameter adjustments helped tune in the perfect experience by changing a few details. Such as increasing the height to make sure it stands out enough but not too much among other buildings. Changing the curvature to optimize shading and testing different thicknesses to give it the right feel without loosing any of its definition. All these factors lead this pavilion to be an excellent structure for inviting new students in during the week of welcome.
