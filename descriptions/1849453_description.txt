My design is an inspiration of the aurora borealis from our Alberta heritage, it implements the waves from the northern lights which fits perfect with the University of Alberta. This pavilion provides shade and allows people to sit under it, can have picnics, protection from the rain, or just in the summer that would provide a nice addition to the beautiful rest of the campus. Initially, I made columns from a material of steel that would provide a nice sturdy foundation for the large wave effect on top. The columns can be adjusted and accordingly impact the wave on top. the columns can be heightened, they can be made thicker or thinner, and you can change the overall width and length of the pavilion as well as changing the frequency of the roof and more! All of the previous also impact the volume when changed which is a crucial part of the design. I attempted at making the colors new ones to match the northern lights which came out beautifully.
