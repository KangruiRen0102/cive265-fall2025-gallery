The design is a small square pavilion where people can meet, get to know each other, and get a sense of community. It also stands to represent a sense of arrival, with a simple shape to show that university will not be too hard. I used materials such as steel and wood to make a modern and natural feel to the university.

I used parametric controls to explore different shapes and sizes of the cylinders I used. These all led me to use controls that helped me understand the relationship of and to link properties and qualities of many cylinders together, like the radius and height. This ensured that the cylinders were always balanced or in a way that made sense. This included the base radius of the cylinders to be larger than the roofing.
