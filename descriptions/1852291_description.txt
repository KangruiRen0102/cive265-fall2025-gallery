This pavilion was designed to create a welcoming atmosphere by illustrating a key aspect of our campus - that being support and stability. This design may look complex, but it illustrates a simple phenomenon of being "trapped inside" a complex or overwhelming situation, while still having surrounding pillars of stability. The pavilion doesn't necessarily provide shade, but an experience when walking in. A series of vertical rods circles the individual, while a series of rods twists around this circle to form a tornado-like shape. This represents the many aspects of support that the University provides to all students, even when their academic career seems chaotic and overbearing and is meant to welcome them into a new academic term. The structure being built of many circular rods represents unity and standing wholly in support of one another, especially since this structure would likely collapse if even one singular rod was missing. Most of the structure is built of circular steel rods and relies heavily on the support of the vertical standing rods. The titanium prisms that line the connections of the rods are for aesthetic appeal. However, they also contribute to structural integrity by stabilizing the rods without weighing down the structure (due to the lightweight nature of titanium alloys). The adjustable parameters for this design include the height of the middle transition circle, the number of rods per section, the support rod thickness and the height of the prismatic beams. These parameters can be adjusted to alter the observer experience by: determining if observers can walk along the outside of the structure (slightly underneath it, if structure is tall enough), varying how much visibility observers have while inside the structure and changing the general aesthetic by adjusting proportions. Overall this pavilion was designed with observer experience in mind and to welcome new students with a complex structure that also holds a deeper meaning.
