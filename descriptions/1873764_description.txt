My pavilion is meant to serve as a place of rest during the week of welcome. The layered timber planks provide areas of shade underneath the pavilion, while the open slats allow for some sun to come through, so groups of people can enjoy each other’s company under the conditions that are most comfortable for them. I decided to have one side of the pavilion completely open in order to show that everyone is welcome and create a friendly atmosphere. The other two sides are somewhat shielded from the outside, however. I thought that this design could be helpful in maintaining the inside of the pavilion as a calm space. A bit of shelter from the hecticness of the week of welcome would help those who are feeling overwhelmed to escape for a moment, without actually having to get away from the main areas of campus. The layered structure of my pavilion also stands to represent the great steps that newcomers will be taking here in their pursuit of knowledge. And the pyramidal structure stands as a testament to the incredible things that can be accomplished by those seeking expanded knowledge.

In my exploration of parameters affecting my pavilion, I realized that both having adjustable width and number of timber planks would allow for choice around the level of sunlight that would be let through the gaps into the pavilion, altering the inside atmosphere. Adjusting the height of the steel cylinders would also change the feel of my pavilion, as having it be taller or shorter may be more/less welcoming to some people, especially when coupled with differing sunlight allowances. I fixed the height of individual timber blocks, though, as I did not want to cut an entire two sides of the pavilion off from outside. The adjustable radius of the rods is to provide different levels of structural support. With these parameters, I feel as though my design is optimized for both relaxation and community connection during the week of welcome.
