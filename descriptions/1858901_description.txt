The Woven Wood Canopy is a pavilion to be installed in Main Quad. It is comprised of wooden helixes twisted around steel rods. On top, the arches and helixes are connected by rectangular blocks to provide structural stability. The Week of Welcome is when students have the chance to roam around and explore buildings. However, despite the amazing summer weather, there aren’t many places to hang around outdoors. The Woven Wooden Canopy offers shade, making it a place to gather. Its twisting helix geometry naturally sparks curiosity, inviting adventurous students to climb and interact with the structure (at their own risk!). The woven form also symbolizes the diversity, interconnectedness, and shared spirit of the university community, making the pavilion both a physical and symbolic space of connection.

I had a total of 6 parameters, all controlled by number sliders: the maximum height of arches, number of intermediate arches, number of helixes (orbits), radius away from the arches, number of turns, and radius of the helixes. All parameters are constrained to prevent geometric conflicts and ensure stable performance. For example, the shortest arch is always defined as half the height of the tallest arch. With the tallest arch set to a minimum of 5000 mm, the shortest arch cannot fall below 2500 mm (2.5 m), ensuring sufficient clearance so visitors can comfortably walk beneath it without risk of head contact. The span and placement of the front and back arches are fixed to ensure the pavilion stays within the green plot. For the best 3D view, I set all the parameters to around their intermediate values, giving a balanced view. The best part about having multiple parameters is you can achieve numerous different looks. For example, increasing the number of intermediate arches and the distance between each helix and its arch, we get a unique “spaghetti” look. The Woven Wooden Canopy is a pavilion that balances art and function.
