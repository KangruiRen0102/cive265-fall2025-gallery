My pavilion design is inspired by the idea of Calatrava’s project. The form uses a lightweight material associated with steel rods that gradually rise toward the center, which creates an experience like walking under a canopy. When pedestrians enter the structure, they move inside and space is more compressed until reach center. This change in space is caused by limited area (10 x 10m) and maximizes spare area. The overlapping curves also cast patterned shadows, creating a visually dynamic and comfortable shaded environment.
The pathway and structure work together to guide new students toward the center space. When standing underneath the middle point, they experience a moment of brief reflective pause, which is like an appropriate “welcoming” for new students into campus life. The symmetrical organization creates a sense of harmony and balance, suggesting that although university life can be challenging, it is manageable through structured planning.
To develop this pavilion, I relied heavily on parametric controls in Dynamo. Several key parameters including overall height, left and right pathway widths, spacing of curves, and curvature intensity which were fully parametric controlled. Adjusting these values helps me to rapidly test variations while keeping the geometry stable and regenerating correctly.
For example, modifying pathway widths allowed me to explore different “entrance conditions,” ranging from narrow passageways to wider until its limit. Height parameters changed the overall sense of openness. Changing the number of arcs helped refine the structural density, which influenced how enclosed or airy the pavilion felt. These experiments showed how sensitive the spatial experience was to small parametric changes, which helps me design the intended emotional effect.
