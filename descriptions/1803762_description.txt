My pavilion design creates a welcoming landmark for students during the week of welcome. The form is defined by three gently curving structural ribs that rise upward and meet a series of wavy vertical elements, creating an enclosure that feels light, open, and dynamic. As people move through the pavilion, the subtle horizontal wave pattern produces shifting shadows and a sense of motion, giving a sense for exploration. The intent is to give students a memorable spatial experience that feels both calming and energizing - symbolic of starting a new academic year in such a large welcoming community that shows support

Parametric controls played a central role in developing and refining this design. Adjustable inputs such as the number of vertical curves (GridU). The pavilion height, wave amplitude, and frequency allowed me to test various spatial effects quickly. Increasing wave amplitude created a more expressive and sculptural type structure. When decreased, it produced a more uniform enclosure. Changing the height and radius modified the openness and proportions of the space, helping arrive at a configuration that feels welcoming rather than imposing. By iterating with these controls, I was able to shape the pavilion to emphasize approachability, comfort, and visual interest, aligning the final form with the intended use for students during the week of welcome.
