The University of Alberta has made a pledge in order to become more energy-efficient, hence why design has a focus on sustainability. The canopy structure itself follows the Trace of the North Saskatchewan River, while a spherical "cave" acts as the real-life embodiment of "Bears Den". The Pavillion floor is made up of Oak Rectangular Boards and the rods are all made up of Pine. The Rods that form the North Saskatchewan river trace have "branches" for hanging up decorations if need be. 
I thought of this design for 2 reasons 1) Rivers are often viewed as a source of connectivity and adventure; I wanted to incorporate elements of edmonton to make students feel more welcome, 2) Week of Welcome is a way for new students to join clubs and fully immerse themselves in the UofA experience. With this in mind I added the "Bears Den" where student clubs can use the area in order to build a sense of belonging on Campus.
I used parametric Controls, such as the XY coordinate number lines, to choose where to place the Bear's Den. I also used a range function in order to control the amount of circular rods in a particular instance. I also used the number lines to adjust the radius of the circular rods. AT first I tried a radius in which all the rods overlapped, however I felt that took away from the nature vibe I was aiming for, so using the slider I changed the radius so that there were noticable gaps between each rod. Furthermore I used a number slider when determing which instances from a list of points would serve as the end points of my canopy, having too many points would only make the structure unecessarily complex and it would cause a lot of overlap, so I chose to have an iteration of every 2.5 points.

(The reason Ive handed this later than 11:59 is due to the fact that Dynamo kept crashing. I wish I was lying when I say it crashed more than 50 times, and each time all my progress would get deleted, safe to say I started clicking the save button every five seconds)
