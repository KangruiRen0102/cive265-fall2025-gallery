My pavilion design provides a welcoming and safe environment for students & freshmen to relax in a community space that is weather-protected. Its open and visible features encourage students to stop by and socialize. Thus this space was also perfect for student creativity, whether it was for an art show, music performance or other outdoor event, this pavilion is the best & perfect place for it. Though the design was low profile with its green colour that merge seamlessly into its environment, it celebrates the UofA pride by using green & gold as its main colour, creating a spotlight during the week of welcome, making it part of the iconic UofA picture for freshmen. 

I applied mathematical trigonometry functions to create the main geometry, with the help of adjustable parameters (integer slide bars). I am able to visualize endless different design combinations by changing the spacing, angle, thickness, curvature and more… even creating better designs by accident.
