The design is a circular pavilion for the quad that creates a shaded space for gathering in smaller groups. The radius of the pavilion changes how many people can gather inside, and it can be increased or decreased to fit within the 10m square or less. The nRibs slider controls whether the space feels open, or densely enclosed. The ribHeight slider adjusts the height of the space, whether we want it to feel monumental or a crawlspace. The curvePull slider changes the curvature of the ribs, affecting the amount of shade and flow of light through the structure. The colHeight and colRadius affects how solid the perimeter feels, whether they be completely solid or they sway in the wind. I used 2 materials for the assignment, one being for the ribs, which is some sort of timber, which expresses warmth for the space. The second material being steel, or some sort of metal to be strong, so that the structure stays in place. The volumes used for each material adjust automatically when each slider is changed.
