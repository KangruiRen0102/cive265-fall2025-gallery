The design I used was based on economically stable designs that I saw online. This design was made to align with the University of Alberta’s goals to aim for a sustainable future. It uses ergonomic and recyclable materials such as wood and steel, rather than using plastics, which burn fossil fuels. I also based the design on a chess piece because it reminded me of the pieces used in chess, consisting of a revolved surface and a rounded shape. The design consists of a wooden base that is curved into an umbrella-like shape. I want to invoke the sense of belonging for new students during the week of welcome by giving them a place to seek shade, meet new friends, and become a spot of gathering for students. This shape is effective in blocking out the sun and purposefully avoids harsh angles in its design to protect students from running into the pavilion and getting injured. The pavilion also uses one cylinder as opposed to multiple supports to lower its footprint and allow more room for students to walk around, something which was very important for me when designing the pavilion, as the quad is already a very busy section of campus. The steel ribs are designed to support the umbrella shape but also to add an aesthetic clash to the wooden base. The number of ribs can be increased to add more support to the hanging part to increase stability and also to add more flair to the design. The height and radius of the canopy can also be changed to create more shade, depending on user preference. The rib thickness can also be changed depending on the designer's aesthetic preferences. When I designed my pavilion, I avoided jagged designs due to the fact that they can feel intimidating. I want new students to feel welcomed and happy coming to school.
