1. When I designed this pavilion, I wanted there to be separate features that would all blend and flow together as one. I wanted my Week of Welcome pavilion to feature these design elements to show incoming students the connections they will have at the University of Alberta. The Steel Rings represent the faculties at the university and how the student will be strongly connected to their faculty, but they will also be connected to all the other faculties at the university, as represented by the wooden beams.
2. I wanted to find the right height, slope and number of steel ring plates for the pavilion, so I created functions that would allow me to change those parameters. At first, I wanted a roof that would have a steeper slope so that I could fit more round steel circles, but after viewing what that would look like, I decided against it and changed my parameters to allow for a less steep slope that would fit fewer circles.
