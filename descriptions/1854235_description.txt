I would like my design to be simple and big enough to fill in many people at first, since this is the first time using Dynamo, will be hard if make it to complicated. My inspiration came from the vocabulary game played before, which you will come up with a word and let others guess the letters in it. If they failed to guess out the word, the finished hangman will be drawn as each wrong guess will result in an arm or etc. The purpose is to make this an area for learning and relaxation by relating to this game which you can enjoy and learn at the same time.
