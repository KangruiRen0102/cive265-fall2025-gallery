This pavilion is called Place of Rest. As the name suggests, I intended to mimic a place of rest, peace, calm, and overall tranquility. I wanted to create a sense of relaxation to ease the worries people may have about the new semester or university (for first-year students). I also intended to foster a sense of community, which I mainly did by choosing the dome's shape. I chose the dome’s “egg-like” shape ultimately because I felt it would be a classic choice and would mimic a homely, togetherness setting. I explored many possibilities when it came to the overall design, and a lot of my considerations came from what I wanted to do for the lighting. So I used a variety of controls to make it so that a thickness slider would be able to control the steel panel covering, allowing certain amounts of light in each time. Adjusting parameters allowed me to experiment with the dome’s grid pattern, its curvature, and height. It enabled me to experiment with how complex I wanted the pattern to be. I don’t have much experience with Python programming, so I heavily relied on what was in the class YouTube videos, Stack Overflow, and various other websites to try and make sense of the code. This allowed me to produce code that affected the dome geometry and the geometry of the panels. Overall, designing the pavilion from its base to its rounded top structure allowed me to enhance my skills in parametric design. It also enabled me to increase my knowledge of Dynamo as a useful design tool.
