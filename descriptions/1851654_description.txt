My pavilion is designed as an inviting landmark in Main Quad to express movement and the kickstart of a new semester in the Week of Welcome. This is represented in the wavy roof, propagating in a balanced manner. The timber columns below have open spaces between them, so that people can enter from any direction, creating a welcoming environment. Through the roof amplitude control, I was able to adjust the sharpness of the wave, ensuring that there was a balance between calm and activity. Not too passive nor aggressive. The column radius was key to create an open and inviting environment, to pique a student's curiosity.
