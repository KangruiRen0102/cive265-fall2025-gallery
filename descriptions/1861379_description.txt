WOW Week is one of the most anticipated events at the University of Alberta, welcoming new and returning students into campus life. As civil engineers, our work is meant to positively shape everyday experiences, and this project allowed me to design a space that serves and connects people. As Dr. Lee says, “We make and manage the surroundings that shape and colour everyday life,” which reflects why I care deeply about the impact of engineering.

The Teepee Pavilion design celebrates the cultural foundation of our university. The U of A is located on Treaty 6 Territory, and the existing tipi outside Athabasca Hall symbolizes Indigenous history on campus. My pavilion extends this acknowledgment into WOW Week, offering a meaningful reminder of the land and community that welcome us here. With over 46,000 students from Alberta, other parts of Canada, and around the world, WOW is the perfect moment to introduce this story and inspire conversation through design.

The circular form invites gathering from all sides, emphasizing community and belonging. The repeated wooden rods create a rhythmic and calming atmosphere while guiding visitors’ eyes upward to express excitement and possibility for the year ahead. The pavilion encourages students to pause, explore, and ask questions about what the form represents and why culture matters in our shared environment.

Parametric controls guided the development of the structure. Adjustable parameters such as base radius, rod thickness, peak height, and rotational angles allowed me to test different spatial qualities and refine the balance between openness and enclosure. Through these iterations, I ensured the pavilion remained visually iconic, functional, and aligned with its cultural purpose.

Overall, this design captures attention, builds community, and honours the history beneath our feet. The Teepee Pavilion welcomes every student into WOW Week with curiosity, respect, and a strong sense of place.
