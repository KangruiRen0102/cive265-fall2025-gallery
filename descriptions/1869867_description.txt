The reason behind my design is to create an area where students can gather and communicate with each other as fellow students. The experience I want pedestrians and new students to have is to feel the identity of being a panda/bear at the University of Alberta, hence being a den. Even though my design is open ended, my goal is that people enjoy walking through the den and also find it as a cozy space to socialize. During the week of welcome, I believe my design has the potential to bring new or current students together by being a topic of discussion, a place to rest and chat, or a place where students can remember that they are now part of the University of Alberta community once they walk through the den with full view of the main quad.

The ways I used parametric controls to explore different design possibilities is by changing the number of instances of cuboids on the arcs, and the number of timber beams within the den. Parametric controls helped me arrive at a form that aligns with my design rationale and purpose by providing live 3D changes which I could manipulate until a desired output was reached. In regards to my design, adjusting the parameters helped me refine my pavilion’s experience and design by helping me define how many cuboids I wanted along each arc, how many timber beams I wanted within the den, and the overall size of each cuboid. Each parametric control assisted me in making a design that is visually appealing, physically feasible, and tall enough so that the den does not feel cramped.
