Flowers represent new beginnings, growth, and remembrance - all of which are central ideas of the Week of Welcome. As well, the start of the academic term is a moment of transition, it is full of anticipation, optimism, and new beginnings. This is what drove my design choice. By designing my pavilion to model a flower, my objective is that users are inspired and encouraged by the promise of new beginnings. As pedestrians approach and move through the flower I want to create a sense of excitement and curiosity- similar to discovering a blooming flower. The open air, organic form, allows for a welcoming and uplifting atmosphere, inviting students to explore and interact. Moreover, I chose green and gold to reinforce school pride, and create a shared sense of belonging. These colours remind students they are a part of a larger supportive community. University can be overwhelming- especially during the first week- which is why a pavilion that symbolizes growth and unity is important to help ease nerves and encourage connection. Parametric controls played a central role in developing and refining my pavilion. By using adjustable sliders, I was quickly able to test alternatives and evaluate how small changes affected the final form and user experience. One parameter controls the number of petals generated in the polar rose, while another adjusts the overall radius of the hemisphere shaped pavilion. Together these sliders allowed me to explore a range of variations in my flower shape’s geometry and identify the best configuration that aligned with my design intent. I also implemented parameters for my beam and column radius, which allowed me to easily study the effects of varied radii; I could see the openness and weight of my design. This process allowed me to find a balance where the pavilion felt inviting and open enough to gather in, but still intimate enough to create comfort and connection.
