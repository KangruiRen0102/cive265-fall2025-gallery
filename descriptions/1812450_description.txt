I added a Pdf with the description. 

Design Concept and User Experience

“The Fire Gathering Pit” draws inspiration from Kamloops BC’s powwow grounds, creating a circular gathering space with vertical timber columns and a partially open roof. This design is mainly centered around the idea of community and cultural connection offering students a welcoming space that encourages interaction and inclusivity. The open roof design offers both shelter and openness for airflow to eliminate a feeling of claustrophobia. This building allows students to feel a sense of belonging and offers relaxing community building. Amid the hustle and bustle of opening week with new students feeling overwhelmed, "The Fire Gathering Pit” offers a calm place to relax and feel more centered on campus, while also offering a place to connect and meet new people.

Parametric Control Implementation 

Four main parameters helped shape this design. The column count, roof height, structural density and base radius allows for a combination of form and experience based on what is desired. By making adjustments to column count and base radius to be able to change the amount of people that could use the space and also how close together everyone would be. Roof height and structural density helps balance the openness of the structure with shelter. This creates balance between the shaded area provided and airflow. Having flexibility like this in my design allowed me to refine the pavilion into a shape that helps people feel welcome and supported while also honoring the cultural inspiration that it was drawn from.
