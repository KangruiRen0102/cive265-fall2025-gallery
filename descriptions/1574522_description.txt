1. The design is intended to represent the waves of an ocean, and spears piercing the surface. Students tend to feel overwhelmed, under pressure and lost, which is all metaphorically related to the feeling of being submerged underwater. This pavilion is meant to evoke both a sense of community and ambition. People gathered under the waves, and the clear view from inside elicit a feeling that maybe that uncertainty and dread isn't so bad.

2. I used a handful of number and integer sliders in my design, mainly to tweak the spacing of both the columns and the beams, along with their width and height. Having a cramped, claustrophobic style would not only look cluttered, but would be counterintuitive to my intentions behind the design. In this way, adjusting the parameters greatly helped refine my design.
