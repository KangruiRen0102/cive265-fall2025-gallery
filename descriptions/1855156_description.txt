1. The overarching rationale for the design of my pavilion is an interest in plants and wanting 
others to have a positive experience as well. Given that the pavilion is a model of a spider plant, I want pedestrians to feel at home, feel relaxed and see something that is natural and aesthetically pleasing. I also want it to be a symbol of growth representing the post-secondary journey. During the week of welcome, new students will be stressed especially if they are not from Edmonton. I feel this stress can be eased by making campus feel like more like home by adding a houseplant. 

2. I mainly used parametric controls to achieve geometry that I felt was natural and representative of the real plant. One of these controls was the amount of leaves on the plant. Using this I could decide if I wanted the plant to look more like a seedling or a mature plant with more leaves . Another important parameter controls the rotation of the leaves, which I utilized to make sure they were spread out in a natural looking way. Parameters relating to arc length and radius were finely tuned to fill the space properly and create varying leaf sizes. The parameters for the benches at the base of the plant were also very important. I could create a variety of designs by changing width, length and number of benches to find which one complemented the plant best.

Additional Notes: Due to the complex geometries of the leaves, the time to generate them can be quite long. Their complexity also makes errors quite prevalent and so the ranges of the parametric controls relating to arc length and radius are quite small to try and ensure that the geometry will generate.
