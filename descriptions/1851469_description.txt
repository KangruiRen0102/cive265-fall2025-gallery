The pavilion is a simple pattern of repeated frames constructed by joining vertical supports with horizontal beams. This forms a lightweight, open structure.

The design includes sliders controlling the number of frames in each direction (nX, nY). "colHeight" changes the overall height of the structure while "colRadius" and "beamRadius" change the thickness of the columns and beams, this allows for the design to be modified comfortably for anyone's needs.

There are 2 Python Nodes used for volumes and geometry. The Timber Column Python script creates the vertical members and finds their volume, whereas the the Steel Beam Python script does the same for the horizontal members. The volumes are displayed with watch nodes.
