In 2021, Valentino Vecchietti designed an updated pride flag known as the "Intersex-Inclusive Pride Flag". This interpretation is the current flag recognized as the current pride flag by the Canadian Government. My goal with The Gateway Towards Diversity was to encapsulate all the meaningful colours that make up Valentino's pride flag and transform it into somewhat of a modern art piece that doubles as a university pavilion. I hope with my design that not only new students and visitors will see the pavilion as a source of inspiration, but that people who walk the university grounds on a daily basis are able to see the gateway as a reminder that inclusivity is paramount. Many issues that society experiences as a whole is due to discrimination upon the LGBTQIA2S+ community. I firmly believe that anyone and everyone is welcome at the University and that nobody should be treated any different based on what they support. I find that the gateway's bright colours are empowering and can serve as a beacon of hope especially in the cold winter months where mental health struggles. I think that it is far too late to be breaking barriers that should have never existed, and the gateway can serve as a monument to the brave souls who have inspired others through pride. 

When designing my pavilion, I knew that i wanted to incorporate something to do with pride. I immediately thought of the pride flag. My idea behind the design is that the colours from the original pride flag would be used as a canopy over the newly added colours serving as a wellness space below where people can take pictures, and enjoy both the feeling of pride and the nature surrounding them. Parametric controls were important in creating unique structures that may not have been able to be created had we used pre defined instances. I utilized techniques from the sample videos shown to create the classes and instances. This use of inspired classes and instances aided in the creation of my pavilion
