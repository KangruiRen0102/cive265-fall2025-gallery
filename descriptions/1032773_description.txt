The Parametric Spirit Pavilion draws inspiration from the Spirit of Belfast sculpture, which symbolizes connection, movement, and the weaving together of community. My pavilion reimagines this concept through three slanted steel columns arranged in a 120° radial pattern around a central vertical column. These angled elements create a sense of motion and convergence, guiding pedestrians toward the pavilion’s open center. A circular disk near the top serves as a shading element, echoing the floating, interlocking rings of the original sculpture while offering a sheltered gathering space for students.

The pavilion is designed for the Week of Welcome, where new and returning students meet, mingle, and form friendships. The open layout encourages people to walk through and around. it, encouraging interaction and spontaneous conversation. Its varying heights, angles, and curves frame dynamic views as users move beneath it, creating a sense of arrival and curiosity.

Parametric controls were crucial in shaping the final design. Adjustable sliders managed the column radii, tilt angle, disk radius, disk thickness, mid-section height, and base dimensions. These parameters enabled exploration of openness versus enclosure, structural balance, shading effectiveness, and visual harmony. For instance, adjusting the column tilt and radius helped create an inviting entry while maintaining structural stability, and changing the disk height refined the amount of light entering the pavilion. Updates to these parameters automatically recalculated material volumes in mm³, ensuring precise quantity estimates throughout the design process.

Through parametric iteration, I developed a graceful, expressive form that balances structure, symbolism, and user experience—a pavilion that captures the lively spirit of campus life and fosters community interaction.
