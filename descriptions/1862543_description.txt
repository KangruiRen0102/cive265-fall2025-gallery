Description of Home assignment 2 

In Home Assignment 2, I designed my pavilion in such a way that it offers a welcoming and memorable experience to the pedestrians visiting the University Quad during the Week of Welcome. The wave design of the roof generates a sense of movement and draws people inwards, acting like an architectural invitation. As they walk through it, they experience the sun and shadow, creating a sense of protection and openness. The structure gets its inspiration from the canopy of the trees, which evokes the feeling of relaxation and arrival. The repeated ribs and clean structure create a sense of order and community while still feeling the light.

Parametric controls were very essential in shaping the pavilion’s final form. By adjusting the rib count, spacing, height, pillar height, radius, and the wave amplitude, I was able to test different possibilities Increasing the rib height created an uplifting experience, while reducing it produced a sheltered atmosphere. Changing the rib spacing made me balance between visual density and openness so that the pavilion felt light. The pillar radius allowed me to have multiple entrances to the pavilion, making it more welcoming to the pedestrians, along with the stability of the pavilion, as they are the most crucial for the pavilion's rigidity.

By making these changes, I was able to refine the pavilion into a shape that maintains structural clarity while expressing movement, flow, and welcome. The parametric approach allowed the design to develop organically, guaranteeing that the pavilion's overall experience matched my goal of creating a welcoming and unforgettable pedestrian entrance area.
