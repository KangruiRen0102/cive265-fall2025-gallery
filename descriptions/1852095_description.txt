Design Concept and User Experience

I named this pavilion the Steel Cocoon. My main design idea is for the structure to wrap around like a caterpillar's cocoon, but to show breakthrough and change—like the insect turning into a butterfly—not shyness or being closed off. The entrance openings and the round hole in the ceiling show that college is the time to leave the 'cocoon' of their first 18 years and step into a much bigger challenge. The round ceiling hole also means guidance or enlightenment.

For the Week of Welcome, I want people to feel amazed and a little confused by how big the building is when they walk in. This feeling helps new students see that their journey ahead is huge, full of new things, but also a bit difficult and strange. However, the rays of light will guide them, making them feel excited and like they have truly arrived with hope.

Parametric Execution

To make this complex shape and unique feeling real, I used many sliders (controls) to allow for high customization. Having many settings helped me constantly test my code and logic to make sure it was correct, which was important because my model has many complex curved surfaces.

The settings were split into two parts: Building Parameters and Material Parameters.

Changing the Building Parameters (like making the building bigger, squarer, or curvier) directly affects how people feel when they look at it. I purposely made the building very curvy for high aesthetic appeal and to make it look new and creative. However, if the goal was to make people feel safer, I could easily change the same settings to make it look squarer and shorter. Finally, the Material Parameters were carefully adjusted so the material looks right and fits well with the final curved shape of the building.
