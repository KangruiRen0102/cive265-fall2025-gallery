The WOW Pavilion serves as a welcoming and convenient multi-purpose space for the university community. The pavilion is intentionally designed to resemble a tree, which symbolizes the sentiments of community, shelter and growth that the space fosters. Its translucent rooftop offers a sense of safety and comfort in sunshine, rain, or snow, while also allowing users to admire the sky and reflect. During the Week of Welcome (WOW), this pavilion can serve as a landmark that is easy to spot from both the front and the back, helping users to find their way and conveniently meet others, creating new connections. In this way, the pavilion not only serves as a place of gathering but it also allows people to easily feel integrated to the university community. Like WOW, this structure aims to embrace its users and nurture their growth throughout their university experience. The comprehensive parametric controls used to explore the design possibilities of this pavilion were height, length, the amount of components making up the pavilion, as well as their thickness. Controlling the length and height of the pavilion allows to see how many people or things could be fit within the space to make it as resourceful as possible (e.g benches, fireplaces, etc.). As changing the length and height controls the capacity of the pavilion, the thickness of components, as well as their quantity, is used to ensure the safety and stability of the structure. Therefore, the parametric controls on this design measure the capacity and safety of the pavilion to be as serviceable as possible for users.
