This pavilion is made from a series of curved ribs arranged in a circle, forming a dome-like structure with an open entrance and a round opening at the top. The ribs change in height and curvature as they rise, creating a smooth, flowing shape. Light passes between the ribs and through the top opening, creating patterns on the ground and making the space feel open and airy. The design is fully parametric, so the size, number of ribs, and shape can be adjusted easily.
