The Unity Arch is a parametric shell pavilion designed as a spectacular, open structure intended for the Week of Welcome (WOW) in the University of Alberta. The arch is intentionally covered, which provides both vital shade on sunny days and practical shelter from rain and even early snowfall, a necessary feature considering Alberta’s climate. This parabolic form offers a feeling of arrival, guiding visitors and defining a clear community space. The entire design is controlled by a system of seven parametric sliders. The overall footprint and height are shaped by the ArchHeight and ArchLength parameters. The amount of the grids is managed by NumRibs_X and NumBays_Y. Finally, the size of the structural members is controlled by the RodDiameter for the steel components and BeamWidth and BeamDepth for the timber elements, ensuring materials volumes update automatically to confirm structural and cost feasibility against all design changes.
