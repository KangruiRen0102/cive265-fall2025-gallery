The goal of my pavilion is to create a welcoming and inviting environment for new students at the Week of Welcome. I used sloped roofs to invite users into the pavilion and guide them from the welcome desk to the seating area. The roofs provide a place of shade and shelter. I kept the walls open so users could be surrounded by the campus, and I used the university’s colours, green and gold, to add some campus spirit to the pavillion. The benches and chairs provide a place for students to socialize and feel comfortable on campus. They are round in shape to embrace students and foster a close, conversational environment. I included an information desk as a place for Week of Welcome volunteers to answer questions and interact with users.

I used parametric controls to adjust heights, angles and thicknesses to arrive at a design that felt proportional. Using parametric design allowed me to come up with different design options and minimize cost by minimizing volumes.

I named my pavilion The Pavilion of Possibilities because it marks the place for new students to begin their university journey. At the pavilion there is plenty of people to meet and things to learn. University opens up many possibilities for students, and the pavilion is a starting point for students to discover those possibilities.
