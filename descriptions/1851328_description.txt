The pavilion titled The Cloudbend Canopy is designed to provide a shaded, relaxing social space for the Week of Welcome. By including a sweeping arc roof extending to the ground on one side, the canopy can be positioned to offer pedestrians a seating area to cool down during the last of the summer heat, while still remaining breathable with a panoramic open side and support beams. During the first few weeks of school, many students can often be seen socializing outside and meeting new people around campus. This pavilion provides them with a much-needed outdoor space to chat with friends, eat lunch from one of the many available food trucks, or even find a quiet spot to review lecture notes. Additionally, the green and gold colours of the University of Alberta reflect our school's distinct identity and create a deeper sense of community pride on campus. Parametric controls within the design were used to help shape the final form; adjusting the height of the polycarbonate arc curve helps to change how enclosed or open the space feels; changing the number of aluminum beam supports allows for balance of visual aesthetics and structural stability; altering the arc-opening angle controls the amount of light, shade, and visibility the pavilion offers; and finally, the thickness of the beams balances strength and weight while also influencing the overall look of the pavilion. By testing these parameters, the canopy pavilion is refined into an inviting, functional, and flexible shaded area that enhances the pedestrian experience during the Week of Welcome for both new and returning students.
