The Welcoming Trees of U of A; is designed to appear as a grove of trees to welcome students as they enter and give then a sense of peace, calm and nature. 
Using the parametric sliders I was able to experiment with the different attributes including the height and over all size of the pavillion. I was also able to expiriement with the amount and angle of the support beams and refine them to an angle that is visually appealing and still not block thepathways and functionality of the pavillion.
