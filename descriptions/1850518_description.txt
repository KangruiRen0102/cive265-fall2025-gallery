The transition to university can often be an overwhelming experience. The Canopy of Calm is designed to add a relaxing touch to the Week of Welcome. This small pavilion is designed to be tucked into a corner of the Quad, offering students a moment of quiet to seek shade, take a breath, and relax during all the excitement. The Canopy of Calm is a minimalist zen structure composed of 4 cylindrical concrete pillars supporting a green roof that's planted with indigenous plants, surrounded by wooden cylinders that create a rhythmic pattern. The green roof and wood detailing promote an eco-conscious future for the minds of future engineers, architects, and leaders at U of A. The design does not shout for attention; rather, it invites an area of pause during this life transition.

The pavilion's structure was created using a parametric model where the radius of all pillars (concrete and wooden detailing) can be adjusted to tailor the atmosphere and balance of the design. Increasing the radius of the pillars creates a more robust presence, while reducing it creates a delicate, lighter appearance. The pavilion's roof thickness can also be adjusted to change the contrast against the wooden detailing. The height of the pillars can also be adjusted to change the roof height; this can impact the shelter and intimacy versus open and airy vibe of the pavilion.

The final design was made by balancing the contrast of all of these parameters to create the most relaxing and zen atmosphere. I kept the radius of the wood detailing cylinders thinner than the supporting cylinders so that pedestrians passing can still see the grass and wild flowers growing from the roof, making it high enough that all heights can pass by but low enough it still has a cozy atmosphere. This achieves the perfect blend of shelter and openness that defines the experience the Canopy of Calm can bring to the U of A campus.
