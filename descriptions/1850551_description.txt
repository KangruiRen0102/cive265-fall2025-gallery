A clean, simple, and structured pavilion that expresses basic geometry with a circular top, a halo with curved slats connecting, and large columns all evenly spaced for aesthetic symmetry. The ribbed dome introduces transparency rather opacity allowing natural light to filter through illuminating the pavilion and giving it a sense of openness while maintaining its structural presence. 

I believe this matches the spirit of the university’s week of welcome (WOW), offering a lit up, accessible space that feels inviting rather than closed off. The center of the structure is intentionally left open, giving students and staff the freedom to use it for orientation booths, information tables, casual gatherings, or anything the event requires. most importantly it also gives students a place to stand around and question why part of their tuition went into building this pavilion.

There is also suppose to be color in this pavilion but unfortunately my laptop cannot load the colors for whatever reason.
