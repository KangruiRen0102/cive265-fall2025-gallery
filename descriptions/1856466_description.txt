My goal for the WaveCrest Pavilion was to create a space where people could escape the extreme heat while ensuring the structure remained visually appealing and engaging. I wanted the pavilion to be more than just a shelter. The Wave canopy extends beyond its initial boundaries, increasing shaded areas. During the Week of Welcome, the pavilion functions as both a landmark and a welcoming gesture, drawing students, guests, and community members together, fostering connection, and creating a sense of belonging. My overall objective with WaveCrest Pavillion was to create an adjustable wave canopy so that other forms, or more convenient and practical alternatives, could be explored to either create more efficiency or provide more aesthetic value. The parametric controls for this specific attribute fundamentally relies on an established cosine wave where the actual control is a parameter controlling the range of angles that we can take for the cosine wave.
Dome size can be scaled to create either intimate, focused spaces or a grand sense of arrival. Entrance size controls accessibility and the perception of threshold, while canopy thickness controls structural presence, shade, and lightness. These parameters enabled rapid exploration of alternative forms, helping refine circulation, shade coverage, visual rhythm, and overall aesthetics. The pavilion becomes a spatial experience that is playful yet practical, providing relief from the sun while remaining visually stimulating.
