The main factors in my design were functionality and visual appeal. I wanted to improve on the visual appeal of the generic steel-frame tents currently used during week of welcome, while maintaining their functionality. The key features i wanted to preserve were the shade created by the tent, and the stable structure. My structure uses curved supports that add to the visual appeal and a green/gold tent that helps connect it with the week of welcome theme. 

My design will give pedestrians a sense of freedom and relaxation. The large openings at the side of the tent promote a free flow of foot traffic in and out of the pavilion, making it a comfortable, non-claustrophobic social setting. The canvas tent cover will give people a cool place to relax on the sunny days of September.

Using parametric sliders, I experimented with different designs for the pattern of the tent structure, and the overall shape of the pavilion (tent segment partitions, arc curvature ratio). Exploring these things helped me settle on what shape would make the pavilion feel the most "open". Modifying the structural properties (truss quantity, steel arc radius) also helped optimize the balance between cost (i.e. material volume) and stability.
