I wanted my design to have some resemblance of the letter “A” to create a “welcome to UofA” kind of atmosphere. This is more apparent when viewed from the front (negative x-axis). I wanted to provide an area where people can enjoy conversations, study, or have lunch. With these goals in mind, I tried to create shade from the sun while letting the breeze through. 
The parametric controls helped reach my final design in many ways. Initially, I had a slightly different idea on how I wanted this to look (I didn’t intend on having the beams cross on the side) but as I played around with the sliders, it “broke” my code and got me the intersections, which I later implemented as a feature of the structure. Being able to change different parameters with a click of a button allowed me to test different configurations of the components very easily. For example, I wanted my structure to have a downward slope as it went back (direction of positive x-axis) smoothly while keeping it looking simplistic. After I had the slider setup, all I had to do was move the “Number of Panels” until I found what I thought was the most appropriate.
