I decided to build the Welcome Wave Pavilion as a symbol of University of Alberta's unique, and beautiful environment. The tall steel ribs represent the high potential of all the smart and creative U of A students. The high columns on the outside of the ribs is a representation of the smart and experienced U of A professors that guide the students to their true purpose and potential. The tall arch this pavilion has provides a space for the new and returning U of A students to walk under during this exciting Week of Welcome. I would like for the pedestrians being able to experience this pavilion to enjoy and appreciate the thoughtful design I've put together. The parametric sliders I've added into my project are there to edit the height and radius of the pavilion to carefully construct it to my liking. By adjusting the parameters I was able to make a tall arch that provides a strong but welcoming image, which will be perfect for the main quad.
