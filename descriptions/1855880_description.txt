For my pavilion, I designed it with the intent of representing a flower. The center steel beam represents the stem while the recycled plastic represents the petals. I chose this as I felt a flower is a perfect metaphor for the transformation made in university. You enter university as a seed: young, needing nurture, and guidance and leave a flower: confident and transformed into a better person. Additionally, I felt as though a flower-like structure would blend in well with the greenery of the quad creating a calming place for students to relax and socialize during welcome week. 
The pavilion is made with two materials: steel and recycled plastic. I chose steel as a nod to Canada as it is a big export and chose recycled plastic as it is an environmentally friendly material. The steel is used in the center beam which supports the other smaller cylinders. The steel is created by a class and controlled by two sliders, one changes the height of the beam, the other the radius. I did this so that the design can change based on the desired size and height of the pavilion. The recycled plastic is used for the cylinders that are hinged to the top of the steel beam. These cylinders were made using a class and their height is defined by the radius of a circle which changes by a slider, allowing for the altering of the span of the shade created by the pavilion. Additionally, the angle of the cylinders in relation to the steel beam is also controlled by a slider. This is done so depending on the time of day you can change where the shade is, for example in the evening when the sun is lower you can move the flaps down. The number of cylinders making up the flap of the pavilion can also be changed to explore how you want the pavilion to look ie. less cylinders with larger radius, or more sliders with smaller radius. All of these parameters are used so that the builders and designers can analyze different combinations to determine which is more fitting for the quad.
