The Collective Ring pavilion is a symbol of unity and community as it acts as a gathering place for the University of Alberta students. The circle shape symbolizes openness, and unity, circles are shapes that never end symbolizing how experiences at the UofA never end, and last forever. The ring shaped timber columns support a plastic canopy to shelter students and staff. 
The structure is controlled by adjustable sliders that control the radius, number of columns, height, roof height, and canopy thickness. There are 2 python classes that underpin the model, TimberMember which defines the structural frame of the timber columns and beams, PlasticPanel generates the elements for the canopy and computes their volumes. The plastic panels are lightweight but durable during rain and wind, and will provide shelter in most outdoor conditions. All geometry and quantity outputs update dynamically through parametric relationships, ensuring precision. The Collective Ring transforms parametric modeling into a symbol of community, providing an inclusive space for students to embrace the collective spirit of the university community.
