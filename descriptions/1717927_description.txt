The Bear Paw Pavilion is inspired by two defining symbols of the University of Alberta: the strength of the Golden Bears mascot and the welcoming, natural character of the campus landscape. The pavilion’s top view takes the form of a bear paw, expressing school spirit in a way that is recognizable but still elegant and architectural, colored in the ever green and gold.
Rising from the center of the design is a vertical trunk with branches supporting the paw. Together, the tree-like form and the bear paw plan merge ideas of strength and belonging: the bear represents resilience and identity, while the tree suggests renewal, connection, and the shared environment of the university.
The pavilion is meant to feel warm and inviting, a place to gather, pause, and orient oneself during the excitement of the week of welcome. By combining campus nature with the Golden Bears heritage, the design creates a welcoming landmark that celebrates both the spirit and the setting of the University of Alberta.
The design is fully parametric: changes in toe count, toe spacing, branch angles, trunk height, and material thickness all update the pavilion’s geometry and quantities in real time. Two Python classes, one for steel branches and one for concrete toe supports, automatically generate geometry and calculate material volumes, ensuring accurate quantity takeoffs for fabrication or 3D-printing
