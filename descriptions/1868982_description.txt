1.) When initially designing my pavillion, I had no idea what I wanted to create. I consulted google for what a pavillion actually entailed and what its main aesthetic and practical function was. I learned that the main purpose of a pavillion is to provide shade within open areas, using this information, I went about the design process in which the pavilion provides a recluse from the chaos and heat of the week of welcome. I designed the pavillion in such a way that users of the pavillion can receive a break from the heat and noise of the week of welcome whilst also having an interesting shape that not only draws individuals to the pavillion but also creates a talking point between strangers, allowing individuals a common ground to begin a conversation with each other.

2.) My basis for the parametric controls was based off of my design idea of a 'Sail", like in normal ships, every facet of a sail can be manipulated to fit the users needs. As such, I went about the design in such a way as to include as many parametric controls as possible, allowing the user to manipulate all portions of the pavillion to suit their needs. However, the form I decided on in the end allowed me to build a realistically feasible pavillion that also allows for a unique shape.
