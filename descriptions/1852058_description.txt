This pavilion uses the definition of being a decorative structure for gathering, rather than a shelter. I tried to model my structure with the idea of repetition, as I find university life is travelling in circles until you reach your destination. I intend for pedestrians to take the idea of the pillar and sphere representing a person beginning a new life. A life filled with circles, revolving in a helix to gain success, and failure, but ultimately reaching the top and achieving their goals. The helices indicate constant looping until reaching the very end, very similar to how university feels during the first few semesters. Additionally, I found this made for a simple, yet interesting display piece. It can fit in for the Week of Welcome whilst not being too eye-catching. To create this structure, a lot of my functions had the use of radius and height control sliders. This structure being composed of circular objects made these two sliders incredibly important as it allowed fine tuning of each component until the scales of the objects were just right.
