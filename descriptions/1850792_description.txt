My design rationale was simple. Literally. I wanted to design a structure that emphasizes the beauty and simplicity of human connection. The true beauty of life can be found within the connections fostered between people. I wanted to provide a space wherein simplicity was valued and connection was encouraged. 
University is a stressful time for many students, especially since many have moved far away from friends and family. Thus, there exists an essential need to foster new connections and form new relationships between students. 
In the context of Week of Welcome, this pavilion, appropriately named “The Connection Bridge,” helps students to bridge the gap between new peers and their campus community. With such a simple yet effective design, this pavilion offers a venue for all students to interact and bond with each other. The focus of the structure is not its architectural marvel or its wonder, but rather on the opportunities it provides for human connection. The pavilion creates a welcoming invitation for pedestrians from its open design. In essence, I want the pavilion to be a reflection of the virtue of community, providing space for relaxation. 
My design featured many parametric controls, from roof dip angle to base width. Since the goal of my pavilion was to be open and inviting I wanted to make the structure as simple as I could. This involved using parametric modeling to remove sharp angles from the corners, lower the dip of the roof, and optimize the number of spheres on the pillars. By using parametric modeling, I was able to make the design appear aesthetically pleasing while keeping true to the goal of simplicity. 
I found that having a steep roof angle made the structure appear foreboding and uninviting, so I settled on having a gentle roof slope. I also determined that having a small base fillet radius made the structure appear sharp and unappealing, so I use parametric modeling to optimize the curvature of the base.
