1. For my CIV E 265 project, I made a pavilion in the shape of a clam. The clam symbolizes strength, perseverance, and an opportunity for growth to everyone within the University of Alberta. The shell signifies immense strength for such a small object. A clam withstands the harsh conditions of the ocean to overcome and thrive in an environment few survive. Furthermore, this building shows a sense of perseverance and success. The clam creates a pearl representative of the success and growth it faced through hardships and calamity. Finally, every clam is different, in colour, size, and the journey taken to become a thing of beauty. I want every student to think of themselves as a clam, a small but strong willed individual ready to face the challenges of the university life, and eventually form a pearl of their own to symbolize all the hard work during their time in university and onwards.

2. The clamshell has several adjustable parameters including the thickness of the steel lips, the thickness of wooden shell and the number of waves wanted on the steel lips. This parameterization allows for a multitude of design possibilities depending on the need. With the python script, users are able to adjust the thickness of either material to fit the need of the amount of materials. Finally, having the ability to adjust the cosine wave of the lips allow for an increased amount of possibilities.
