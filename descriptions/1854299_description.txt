My pavilion is a circular gathering space with vertical timber posts and a steel ring above. The full circle creates a welcoming environment and draws people in where they can interact and make new friends. The continuous loop is meant to bring a sense of inclusiveness and shared space where people can see that University is a community. I also wanted the pavilion to be a free and open space. There are gaps between the timber posts and even a large hole in the roof allowing for good airflow. University students already spend a lot of time indoors in lecture halls, so I didn't want the pavilion to feel stuffy and restricting, and for there to be lots of natural light. The spaces between the timber poles also allow for students to quickly pass through the pavilion instead of blocking their path. Overall, I wanted my pavilion design to be a physical and symbolic environment where students feel free and safe to gather and connect with each other. 

I used parametric controls such as the height, number, and thickness of posts, the thickness of the steel ring and the radius of the circle to adjust how enclosed or open the pavilion feels. Taller posts make the pavilion feel open, but I didn't want it to be too tall. Thicker and more quantity of posts decrease the gaps in between making the structure more closed in and restrict the movement of people through the structure. But having too thin posts or not enough could cause the structure to fail. For the steel ring I wanted it to be thin as the weight may cause the structure to collapse but still thick enough that it’s visible as I consider it a more decorative touch. For the overall radius of the circle I didn't want the area to be too small that it feels packed, but I didn't want it to be overly open that people aren’t mingling, and defeating the purpose of the pavilion. Overall I used these parameters to see and adjust how enclosed or open the pavilion feels, how people move through it and how it visually looks.
