The wave like roof and warm color of the timber are meant to create a cozy feeling in the middle of the busy quad. Much like a wave, the form symbolizes the new wave of students arriving for the week of welcome, all settling under the shared University of Alberta identity. The soft sag in the roof is meant to bring the canopy down closer to people, so it conveys a sense of protection and grounding to allow people to relax and talk in the shade with an open view of central campus. The posts were specifically chosen to be steel with a cooler white color which makes the space feel secure and more appealing during a hot sunny day. Spanning along the edges and across the roof the black dots and thin black strips mimic the role of bolts and cables. For me they represent individual students threaded together into a connection around the pavilion, tying the whole roof and community together. 

Parametric controls were essential to reaching this final design. I used sliders for length and width to restrict my design to the allotted area but also to allow for customization of the dimensions in the future. The Height (H) and amplitude (A) sliders were used to adjust the wave and find the perfect shape for the roof. I tested shallow and deep versions and landed on a curve that feels cozy but ensures good head clearance and sight lines. The number and spacing of the frame lines, their thickness, and the post radius were all adjusted until the pavilion looked structurally reasonable. Together these parameters let me quickly explore and refine the pavilion so that its form supports the idea of a threaded wave of welcome.
