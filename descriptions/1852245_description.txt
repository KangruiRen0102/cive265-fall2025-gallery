My aim with my pavilion design was to use symmetry to draw attention to the differing experiences and life paths that intersect among students during college, and most especially during week of welcome. The pavilion is meant to act as a short shelter for students, whether from the elements or from the overwhelming energy at the university. People should be able to have a calm place to re-orient themselves before returning to the hustle and bustle of the university. It is designed in a way in which students can be on either side in the small shelter, they catch their breath, they exist in the same space for a period of time, and then just like in life, everyone exits to start their own journey. As students, our lives intersect for a brief time in university, and then we leave to start new adventures and may never see each other again. I wanted to capture these brief moments of pause and community in my pavilion design. As you can see, the pavilion is made of two parallel rows of rods, connected by a diagonal series of rods, and then a small roof acting as a shelter. Adjusting the parameters helped me emphasize this feeling of brief connection, our spaces join and then we separate, and that is good and natural and beautiful to experience. As students our lives may never again meet, just like the pathways of these rods, but the time we spent in each other's lives was valuable and did make a difference, the same way this pavilion is supported by the intersecting pathways of these cylinders.
