With this design, I wanted to greatly focus on harmonizing the pavilion to its surroundings. When thinking about the QUAD area that it would be placed in, I was influenced by the surrounding nature and trees in contrast to the newly developed buildings--especially CCIS. I also enjoyed how sunny and warm it's able to get due to the openness. Therefore, I wanted to create a design that incorporates sunlight and the more modern aesthetic of our faculty buildings. When observing the pavilion, I chose to design more fluidly to eliminate the awkwardness of corners stemming from angular, box-shaped layouts. The circular placing of the foundational steel and gradual change in heights convey the welcoming of sunshine--with this being further exemplified by the glass roof. The glass may be customized with tints and colours (or even stained glass) to create unique shadows and transmitted light. While walking around campus, I've also noticed wind-spots and areas with an affinity for breezes, therefore I designed to keep this factor in mind. The separation of elements allow for airflow, which can be enjoyable during the warmer weather of the transitional period from Summer to Fall. Ultimately, I want my pavilion to create a feeling of excitement as new and returning students come to campus during WoW.

For the parametric controls of the design elements, I mainly focused on the thickness of each component--which would mainly affect the amount of sunlight and and wind that comes through. The other parametric controls change the slope and angle of the roof, which I wanted to incorporate as a ways to make visual contrast and flow. I strongly wanted to avoid creating a box-like design as it seemed too boring for the area it would be placed in. Being able to change the angle of the roof helped prevent this while also creating an opportunity to make cool shadows as he sun makes its daily path through the sky.
