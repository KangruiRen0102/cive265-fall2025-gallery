Formed from steel and concrete this pavilion center stone provides both elegance and function to wherever it may be built. Designed after a traditional tipi a modern spin is added, forming the spine with steel rods and the base with a concrete pad; not only is this structure built with strength but with the availability for function. Placed in the center of the pavilion is a row of benches which all wrap around a main podium tucked within the support rods. This allows for community and growth, a shared space which can be used to present, speak, congregate, or whichever one would like with the space. The open design allows for just enough separation from the outside to allow focus on the presenter, but also allows those nearby to become intrigued in a topic and possibly join if the amount of benches permit, if not there is plenty of standing space in the structure to stop in and listen. Using the parametric controls I was able to quickly find the best combination of geometric configurations and structural relationships for the pavilion. By defining adjustable parameters such as rod radius, platform area, spacing, curvature of the benches, I could manipulate the form in real time and observe how each change affected the overall spatial experience. This parametric setup allowed me to experiment with variations that would have been slow or difficult to test manually. For example, modifying the curvature of the concrete benches helped me balance interior space, while adjusting the radius of the support rods allowed the pavilion to shift from dense and enclosed to more open and lightweight. The base diameter parameter helped ensure the proportions remained grounded and harmonious as other components changed.
