The Welcome Mats pavilion is designed to be a play on the idea of having a welcome mat at your front door, but in this case, instead of being on the ground the mats make up the roof of the pavilion. The goal of this would be that it leaves people entering the quad with a bit of a giggle. It's meant to create the feeling of being welcomed into a home, like by a welcome mat, but also making a bit of a joke out of it. I know that my first time entering the quad I was terrified, and having a welcome statue like this, both a symbol of welcome and a strange play on words, would've made me giggle and calmed me down a little bit. In creating my design I played with lots parametrics, including length, width, height, angles, and even the number of “mats”. It really allowed me to play around with the way the pavilion looked until I liked it. I started off with one singular mat/roof, then three uniform roofs, and finally ended with my pavilion. I liked being able to give each roof its own character, adjusting the angles and sizes and placements. Now each mat looks a bit different, like they belong to different houses. Using the parametrics gave me so much freedom in designing my pavilion because I could try everything I wanted without really changing anything.
