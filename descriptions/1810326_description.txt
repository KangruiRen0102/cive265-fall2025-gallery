My design concept for The Pillars of Growth was inspired by the idea of welcoming students into a space that symbolizes progress, elevation, and community. The pavilion contains two different arcs of rising vertical columns, one is larger in the vertical rod height and thickness. The difference symbolizes the upward movement and growth one makes after coming to university. It reflects the years of personal and academic growth that you gain during your time at the U of A and the Week of Welcome is the beginning of it all. As the students/pedestrians move within the arced walls, the different heights and spacing of the pillars create a dynamic experience. The aluminum roof on the outer rods is lightweight compared to the steel bars it lies on, and it connects the space and provides a small amount of shade or shelter.

Parametric controls were useful to explore different heights, spacing, and radii. By manipulating parameters such as the height of the steel columns I was able to play around with the roof location and the difference between the two different arcs of steel rods. Increasing the steel rod height created a more dramatic example of upward motion and growth, while decreasing it helped make the pavilion feel more connected and intentional. The radius sliders for the line base of the two arcs allowed me to adjust the size of the overall pavilion without having to remake anything. I tested how each variation of change in the sliders affected the overall flow and movement of the pavilion. Parametric controls also helped refine the overall form to ensure that the pavilion felt welcoming rather than imposing, and that it supported the project’s purpose to create an engaging, uplifting experience that celebrates new beginnings and encourages students to look forward to the year ahead.
