My design is Slatted Roof Pavilion with Four Support Columns. Every major component of the pavilion is controlled by the sliders in Dynamo as I wanted my design to be fully parametric and simple. The pavilion's dimensions, the height of the columns and the dimensions of the slats automatically change on moving the sliders.
The roof is supported by the four columns that define the main structure. Their height and spacing can be changed, which helps me test different proportions. In order to prevent the slats from floating, I added two beams to the top of the columns. The roof is made from a series of evenly spaced slats. I chose this because, despite its simplicity, it still produces a pleasing effect when the slat width or quantity is altered. I was also able to quickly experiment with various shading patterns by making the roof slats parametric.
I made two Python classes, one for the columns and beams (Material 1) and the other one for the roof slats (Material 2) to link the design with the coding portion of the assignment. Every class has a small method that returns the volume and stores the geometry. I loop through the Dynamo geometry in the Python nodes that turns each each piece into an object, and then determine each item's volume. Every time I move a slider, the total material volume changes, demonstrating the cooperation between the geometry and the coding. Overall, the pavilion is meant to be a straightforward open structure with distinct parametric behavior, it demonstrates object oriented structure and repeated geometry generation. The sliders and the volume outputs helped me look through different versions and understand how small changes affect the design.
