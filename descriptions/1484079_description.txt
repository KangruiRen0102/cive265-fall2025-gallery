1: The idea behind this design is to have a place of shelter where people can come to cool off it is a warm day, or a place to warm up if the day is cold. The supports are made form stainless steel, which is resistant to heat, as well as corrosion. The roofing is just a simple plywood slab that would be coated and treated to allow it resist the elements. The curtain is a durable curtain designed for use outdoors, insulating and protecting the inside from the outside elements. The track that it hangs from is made to allow the curtain to be opened and closed as needed to create the best environment inside. 
The experience that this is meant to have is that of rest and relaxation. It is designed to resist heat and water, so depending of the weather and temperature, could be opened and create a mist room to allow pedestrians to stop and relax and cool off during warm days, or stop and rest inside with a heater inside, allowing coming inside to stop and war back up. With the curtain being the green of the UofAs priary colours it would also bring a sense of community.
2: Using the parametric controls allowed the design to evolve as parts of the structure were completed. Being able to adjust the elements in real time made it easier to see the next part that would build upon that and come up with how the next pieces would get built. With the arches, being able to add more gave way to the idea of adding a circular roof, and from there, the idea of the track to hold the curtain, and allowing to be opened and closed. Being able to adjust the elements at will allows the vision of the pavilion to become clearer when certain items are adjusted in a certain way, like changing the height and seeing how the arches curve, and seeing a better way to construct them.
