The Global Gateway Pavilion


The pavilion is titled The Global Gateway Pavilion, focusing on the U of A's multiculturalism to create a sense of belonging during WOW. The elevated sphere represents the global campus community and universal knowledge, prompting students to reflect on their origins and future aspiration. This symbolizes their descent from their previous life and future ascension via their degree.

The square rods symbolize the student's chosen degree—the structure that will hone their skillset. The double angle and unique intersection of the rods remind students that their individual path will look different from peers, yet their end goal (graduation/career) remains the same. This geometry also emphasizes their unique global impact.
The design meets WOW goals by providing a sense of arrival to their new chapter. The hollow, shaded interior and large entrance encourage gathering and congeniality. Short, outward-facing "stools" offer a relaxing spot for individual reflection, allowing students to "fully take in" their new environment and reminisce on past achievements.


Parametric design was crucial for aesthetic refinement and geometric control.

1. Rod Geometry (Class & Instance): A class defines the rod's four orthogonal sides. A series of instances iterates the class 20 times in a circular plot (with a hard-coded 300-degree opening). Number sliders control the rod's height, angle, offset, and width. This ensured natural light entry while maintaining structural integrity.

2. Sphere Refinement (Class & Instance): A sphere class instance controlled the radius and elevation. Parametric control here was vital to prevent rod protrusion while maintaining a visually dominant sphere to emphasize knowledge. Iterative "play" with these parameters achieved the necessary realistic ratio and aesthetic balance between the supporting rods and the symbolic sphere, making adjustments "copacetic" and avoiding disjointed hard-coded elements.
