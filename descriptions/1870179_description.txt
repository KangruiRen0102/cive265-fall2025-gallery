For my final design, I created a parametric pavilion I called the Rising Canopy Pavilion. The whole model is driven by a set of sliders that control the overall length, passage width, number of frames, column heights, and radii. While testing different values, I found that even small adjustments could noticeable shift the overall geometry of the structure, which made the entire building process very interactive. I built the structure using two Python classes: one for the timber columns and one for the steel beams. The columns generate in two parallel rows, and their heights smoothly transition from the starting value to the ending value which gives the pavilion its elevating look. The beams span between columns, and their shape shifts based on the wave amplitude slider, letting the form move from simple and linear to slightly animated. After generating the top points for each column, I used curves along both sides and lofted a surface between them to form a clean canopy. Because before this, it could have been defined as a pavilion but I believed having a roof concept would just be an extra addition so it can be practically used as cover for bad weather. Everything updates when a slider changes, so the pavilion reacts smoothly as variables change. The process involved building the core geometry first, then layering in the less important controls like beam count and roof behavior, which gave the sliders more meaning and more customizable. The final result is a simple pavilion that stays within the required boundaries of ten meters by ten meters.
