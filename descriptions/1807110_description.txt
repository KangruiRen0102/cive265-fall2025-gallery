As an aspiring Engineer, I prefer designs that are simple, elegant, and efficient. That's why in my design, I took inspiration from the nearby sculpture in Main Quad, South Flats by Sir Anthony Caro. I wanted to create an open concept that maximizes space inside to allow people to socialize and find their community, especially during reading week as its the best time to make new friends. It incorporates weathered steel in the hollow roof supports, this was done to decrease cost while keeping strength, and the material choice was to honor and compliment south flats. The roof is corrugated aluminum for an industrial but elegant look and durable weather resistance. The wood support is there to angle the roof and ensure water drains properly. I used parametric controls for the size of the vertical support poles to allow for changing size based on what people find visually appealing and what's cost efficient. I also used parametric control on the diameter of the horizontal wood support, this was done so that optimal drainage could be created based on the slope for the roof. If the design were to be changed or modified, I would add a way to move the vertical supports in to make the pavilion have an overhang on all sides which maximizes available space to cover people in the event of rain or extreme heat etc.
