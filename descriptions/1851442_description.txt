1. Design Concept and User Experience:
The primary feelings that I wanted my pavilion to invoke were belonging, interest, and connection.
I wanted my pavilion to allow foot traffic through it, so I made sure to include doors opposite one another, with a passage in between. This would allow busy students walking from class to class to enjoy the pavilion. However, I also wanted some semi-private sections in which benches or tables could be installed, which is why there are no doors in the sides.
I wanted a geometric feeling and texture to the pavilion, which would invite pedestrians to view it as an art piece rather than just a structure. 

Particularly in the context of Week of Welcome, I envisioned the UASU setting up booths in the semi-private sides. Students could pick up pancakes, play carnival games, or learn about the Student Union’s services, all while enjoying the shade of the pavilion.



2. Use of parametric controls
I tried to use parametric controls anywhere that I found myself simply inserting a number. 
My parameters include the number of arcs in the structure, the number of divisions in each arc, the minimum and maximum x-coordinates, the thickness and height of the beams, and the thickness of the surface. I adjusted the heights and thicknesses until I felt the pavilion had a balance of structural soundness/stability and aesthetic elegance. Then, I adjusted the minimum and maximum x-values until the entryways seemed sufficiently large, without the whole structure becoming too small. Finally, I adjusted the number of divisions in each arc and the number of arcs. I originally expected that increasing these values would improve the structure, similar to increasing the quality of an image. However, I discovered in adjusting these parameters that lower values added more interesting geometries. By adjusting these parameters, I significantly improved the parabola by better fulfilling my goals described in part 1.
