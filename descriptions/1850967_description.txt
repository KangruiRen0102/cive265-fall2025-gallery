The Horizon Pavilion is designed to give walkers a break from the elements and a natural enclosure, which is given by the wood paneling. The steel ribs give structure and pattern to the pavilion. The elevated curved roof always walkers a feel of entering a new world with vast opportunities while leaving the pavilion, which is perfect for a Week of Welcome excitement as well as welcoming them to the university campus. The length of the pavilion allows natural light to gradually dim before getting brighter at the end of the pavilion symbolizing the opportunities that the university has to offer.

I used parameters including rib and panel thickness, rib number, rib curvature and pillar height to modify the design of the pavilion. These sliders were important in deciding the final design after finding the base structure. By having the ability to see how changing the parameters changed the overall design of the pavilion I was able to tweak each parameter to better fit the purpose of this pavilion. Overall I believe the design I settled on best fits the purpose of the project and gives a functioning pavilion design that can be brought to life.
