So to preface, I am not versed in python at all. I transferred from a university to utilizes C++ as the programming language of choice for first year engineering programming. So all to say, this is very minimal.

My idea behind this is to create a very simple piece that would not require much construction. Those who visit it could take photos on it, walk or even lay on it. A very minimalistic piece that does not look extremely out of place while simultaneously looking sleek and modern.
