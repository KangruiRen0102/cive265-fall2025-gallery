The Gathering Gazebo

This simple, circular gazebo creates an open welcoming space for the Week of Welcome. Formed within durable timber columns, this inclusive gathering circle offers a central table, while the steel roof provides shelter with open sides for airflow. The Gathering Gazebo offers students the opportunity to come together, share stories, and feel the university’s warm welcome. The central table symbolizes the heart of campus culture, encouraging interactions and creating memorable first impressions.

Four sliders control the number of timber columns, roof height, roof thickness, and gazebo radius. Certain parameters, such as fewer columns, can be optimized to create intimate small -group conversations. The possibility of a larger radius accommodates larger Week of Welcome gatherings, while the roof height can be adjusted to protect against rain. Additionally, roof thickness adjustments demonstrate material efficiency. The overall parametric design allows the opportunity for simple adjustments to make the Gathering Gazebo a comfortable experience.
