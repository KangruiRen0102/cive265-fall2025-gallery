The pavilion is based on a friendly, natural shape of a pitched tent, symbolizing a building that is used to collect, shelter and community. In the case of the Week of Welcome, it is to make it an environment that sends the message of reaching your destination and home. When students and visitors pass or enter the pavilion, I would like them to feel like a part of the family and feel comfortable and open. The tent-shaped geometry is informal and approachable to people where they can stop, relax and meet new people during the hectic first week of the semester.

The color of the Tipi is University of Alberta green and gold which enhances the spirit of the school and turns the building into a landmark to commemorate the campus. At the same time, the form also acknowledges the fact that the U of A is situated on the land of the Treaty 6 and the habitat of different First Nations, Métis, and Inuit, very subtly. The pitched form has an appeal to the historical heritage of the native shelters such as the tipi or the canvas shelters, which existed in the past all over the Prairies and, thus, the building is linked to the architectural experience of the Indigenous people and their love towards the land.

As far as the design-development perspective is concerned, parametric controls were central in the scope. Adjustable parameters allowed me to control the height of the posts that were supporting the Tipi, the angle and the length of the surfaces of the Tipi and the size of the pavilion footprint. Through these values I was able to test versions that appear more open, more enclosed, taller or more intimate within a short period of time. The angle of the Tipi was raised so as to add a more iconic and dramatic form though, the base was expanded in order to make the pavilion appear more community and easily approachable in any of the directions. The parametricism helped me to make smooth and continuous alterations to the shape until I felt my desired experience.
