The Golden bear pavilion is designed to give students an opportunity for social interaction and relaxation. The structure begins as a series of individual ribs rising from one side of the pavilion to the other, converging into a gentle, wave like form that represents new beginning s and excitement of the first week on campus, where new students connect with peers and form meaningful friendship. The open sides allow visitors to move freely through the space, while the vaulted timber ribs provide shelter and a sense of enclosure without blocking the view of the quad area. The stepped seating area also offer flexible use, such as casual sitting, student group meeting , watch performances, and gathering during outdoor events. By encouraging these activities, the pavilion helps foster a strong sense of arrival and community. The pavilion develop using multiple adjustable parameters that shape both the roof geometry and usability of the space. Slider controls allows the control of the rib count, spacing of the roof curvature, seating height, depth, and overall width and length of the pavilion- allowing rapid testing for different architectural outcomes. Each parameter update automatically regenerated the timber rib elements along seating and floor solids volumes, enabling the opportunity to find the optimal design outcome. The ability to adjust curvature of the ribs creates balance between shade, openness, and aesthetics. This parametric process allowed me to refine a form that aligns closely with pavilion's purpose of visually exciting, yet functionally accessible for a large group during Week of Welcome.
