I designed this pavilion inspired by flowers such as the lotus and cherry blossom. Since it is being installed for the Week of Welcome, I wanted the design to symbolize new beginnings and growth, reflecting the start of a new semester. The name, “Blooming Paths,” reinforces this idea, representing the new opportunities and journeys students embark on at the start of the school year. Using a flower as inspiration also connects to nature, which has been shown to reduce stress and create a sense of calm and relaxation—perfect for welcoming students to campus. 

The main parameter I used to explore design possibilities is the number of petals. By adjusting the number of petals and their width, the pavilion can take the form of a lotus, cherry blossom, or lilac. These parameters also allow for control over the pavilion’s overall scale, including petal size and height, giving users flexibility to explore different visual and spatial experiences. This approach let me refine the pavilion’s form so it feels inviting, visually engaging, and perfectly suited to welcoming students and celebrating the start of the semester.
