My design consists of four curved steel rods that extend from the corners of the pavilion to a common point in the center of the design, at a variable height. These rods connect many ropes that form an interconnected design that joins all four sides of the structure.

The experience I want to create with this design is a sense of union and connection between students, with it being an open and illuminated area that still provides some shade, making it a good spot to relax under.

The parameters i made changeable were the thicknesses of both the rods and the connecting ropes, the spacing and amount of the ropes, and the height of the entire structure.
