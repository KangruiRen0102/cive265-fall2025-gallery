1.I wanted to create a place where students could hangout in the quad that provides shade and gives a place to meet in comfort. To that end I envisioned there being tables to rest or work inside. I tried to make the design that would work during the summer to keep cool and added rotated planks to ensure snow doesn't build up and collapse the structure. I wanted to create a sense of community around the pavilion that allows people to communicate. Additionally the pavilion is slanted like a triangle which gives a sense of stability.

2.I used parametric controls to control various aspects of the pavilion. I had sliders for the number of points along the line, and sliders for all most dimensions, as well as rotation for the Wood. Doing this allowed me to easily use sliders to change the size of the various parameters. One of the most important being the rotation slider allowing me to change the rotation of the planks with ease. I’m able to make the sides more closed or adjust the size to leave gaps in the structure. This is important for determining the feel of the structure.
