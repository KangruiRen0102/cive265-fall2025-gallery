The design for my pavilion is focused on being welcoming and exciting to new students. Since the pavilion is circular students can enter and exit from any direction, which means students will feel invited but also not suffocated if it becomes too crowded. Lots of cylindrical columns provide a place for students to lean on for comfort or briefly rest, and the high ceiling provides a place for students to hide from the sun or other elements. My goal is for the pavilion to be a place of comfort, where as also being a good meeting point or location for decorations to help excite the new students. 
The parametric controls help change the shape and feel of the pavilion. By adjusting parameters such as number of columns, column height, location of columns, base diameter, I was able to change the open space while also balancing the way the pavilion would make students feel. Too many columns or too thick of columns made the inside feel cramped, whereas too tall of columns or too few columns made the pavilion feel unstable. Changing the parameters allowed me to quickly run through possible alternatives and determine the option that maximized being welcoming and exciting while also being structurally sound.
