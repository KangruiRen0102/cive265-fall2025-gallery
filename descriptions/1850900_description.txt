For the weeks of welcome, one thing I that I noticed as a student at the Uofa is how most of the students get burnt under the sun due to the lack of shade being in the main quad. This realization was the main motivation to build what I called "The Shayde Shelter". This structure is made to help a couple students to rest under shade while enjoying the programs that are being presented over the Week of Welcome. This structure could also help organizations with their presentations so they can stand under shade without being burnt under the sun and present for as long as they would want. To get into the specifics of the design, I mainly used steel cylindrical rods so they could be a base for the roof that is above. I made sure they were evenly spaced but also looked unique and aesthetically pleasing. They are big and strong enough to also support the shade panels that are metallic as long as they are planted in the ground firmly. There are two metallic shade panels supported by the cylindrical rods. One unique thing I added to this structure was how the cylindrical rods are tilted to the right a little bit by using a number slider onto the python code of the cylindrical rod. The other parameters that could be manipulated on the cylindrical rod are Radius, height and angle. The angle is manipulated by using a integer slider where the cylindrical rod could more around in one spot, basically like tilt around at the same spot. 
The manipulation used for the Shade Panel is the thickness and the width, where those are manipulated according to their position in the structure.
