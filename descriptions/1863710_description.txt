This pavilion was designed with the intention to create an open and inviting space for students to gather under. During the Week of Welcome, temperatures are still high, so having a shaded area for students to retreat to is very important. With this in mind, I created a space that will provide the necessary shade and will be rigid enough for students to lean against. It is also high enough for pedestrians to walk underneath, therefore not disrupting the flow of foot traffic. The open concept also provides a sense of welcoming, and it may be made in school colours to enhance the atmosphere of school spirit. 
The most important parameter to me was being able to create a large surface area to maximize the shady region it will produce. Using number sliders I could move the coordinate of my intersection to be higher and move it towards the x-axis to see how that would change the area. I also created a slider to adjust the maximum height of the pavilion to see what was most visually appealing and welcoming. Being able to visualize the change in dynamics by these small changes helped to foster a pavilion worthy for the Week of Welcome.
