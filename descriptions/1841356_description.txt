My pavilion is inspired by a blooming flower which for me represents new beginnings and welcome. During Week of Welcome, the three timber open different directions to greet students coming from different paths. The raised petals make a light canopy that feels open and festive not closed or heavy so people can see inside and feel invited to walk in. The circular seat and central column create a small hang out and meeting spot: students can rest, chat with friends or watch short talks or performances. Volunteers can also use the centre as an information point, standing in the middle while others sit around the ring, so the pavilion acts as a small "welcome hub" on campus. 

I used sliders in Dynamo to control the number of ribs, inner and outer radii, the three petal heights, shell thickness, seat radius and height and the vertical offset between the seat and the petal roots. By adjusting these values I tested how much of the 10 m * 10 m footprint to use, how tall the highest petal should be and how low the petals could start while still giving comfortable headroom. Changing the petal heights and radii helped me tune how open or sheltered the pavilion feels from different directions, which is important when many new students are arriving at once. Playing with seat radius and base height helped me balance sitting space with circulation around the centre. The parametric controls let me move quickly between options and finally choose a form that fits my goal: a flower like pavilion that feels welcoming, gives people a place to pause and supports WOW activities.
