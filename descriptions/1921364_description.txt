The key components of the environment the pavilion is trying to present are structured, uplifting, and communal as W.O.W. (the Week of Welcome) at the University of Alberta is meant to embody these emotions for new students. The columns allow students to feel like they can enter the space without simply just “passing-by”. The dome reinforces a feeling of welcome and inclusivity. Its prominent visibility demonstrates arrival as it is a landmark that can be seen from a large distance. Being underneath the dome, the user experiences a sense of uplifting and openness to help establish W.O.W. 's goal of giving students a feeling of new beginnings. The combination of vertical columns and the dome invokes both stability and celebration for the users. 
The parametric controls were a useful tool to help explore several design possibilities without revisiting the geometry of the design. For instance testing a fewer column count changed the environment to feel more comfortable and more casual. I was able to find a balance where the column count felt structural without making the pavilion feel too densely structured. Column height directly influenced the sense of scale and comfort for the user, where taller columns invoked a much more dramatic feel, and shorter columns made the space feel closed in. The chosen height allows users to feel they are entering a special space without being intimidated by the daunting scale. The radius of the pavilion was chosen to make the space feel more intimate, where a larger space felt daunting. The chosen radius of the dome creates a soft canopy, unifying the columns but still allowing daylight and sky-views. Each adjustment revealed new experiential qualities, allowing me to align the structure with the emotional tone of Week of Welcome: a place that feels both momentous and inviting, encouraging students to pause, connect, and recognize that they are now part of a larger community.
