The CylindriComms is a small pavilion designed as a place to meet, pause, or simply walk through. It features a roof of timber beams that provide shelter and shade, while the evenly spaced vertical rods around the sides let light in and allow visitors to move freely through the space. The repeated cylindrical forms give the pavilion a fresh, sculptural aesthetic that stands out from other buildings on the U of A campus, making it a visually striking and refreshing addition. The design is simple, approachable, and flexible, achieved through parametric controls that adjust the cylinders’ size, spacing, and arrangement, each based on separate classes and instances. The CylindriComms creates a welcoming third space for social interaction, eating, or simply enjoying the structure.
