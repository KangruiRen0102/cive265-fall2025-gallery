The Elytra Pavilion aims to captivate the interest of newly enrolled students upon the week of welcome (WOW). It's unique and abstract design allows it to capture and maintain the gaze, attention, and interest of anyone who walks on campus. I want people to walk into the greenspace of UofA, and fixate their eyes on this new fixture, pondering it's purpose, process, design, among other inquires. The main goal of the Elytra Pavilion is to spark interest and curiosity incentivizing new students. The openness of the structure suggests a welcoming environment, allowing natural light whilst offering shade. I chose circular rods as my base shape as it offers a "flowy" design. By incorporating curves as opposed to hard corners, student are subconsciously suggested to freely move about the space, where corners might suggest a conscious decision to leave or enter the pavilion. Lastly, when leaving the pavilion, I want student to feel like there's a whole new world ahead of them. It is a goal for the students to be immersed in the pavilion, and then bask in the sunshine of potential for everything and anything throughout the university. Leaving the pavilion means entering a new world of experiences, memories, and learning, but being prepared. This pavilion aims to subconsciously invite students in, immerse them in their potential at the university, and then send them off into their new world. 

The parametric controls incorporated in this design typically involved a number of number/integer sliders, revolving around changing radius, height, number of rows, number of columns, and width. Changing these parameters allowed me to play with the different aesthetic purposes involving the columns and cylinders, allowing student to freely and subconsciously move about the pavilion without worrying about where to go next. The green and gold netting connecting these pillars demonstrates the UAlberta patriotism and support for our athletics and motto.
