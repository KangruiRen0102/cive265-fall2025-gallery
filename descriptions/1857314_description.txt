This pavilion is inspired by a child's parachute and has some aspects that resemble a circus tent or a carousel. All of these elements along with the colorful light that flows through the translucent stained-glass roof create a playful atmosphere of joy, anticipation, and childlike wonder. This pavilion is a structure to welcome new students and young adults to embrace their inner child and encourage them to freely enjoy the week of welcome. The structure can provide a slight reprieve from the sun while remaining open, bright, and welcoming. The structure is open so people can freely come and go as they please and return when they want rather than having to claim a spot. The shelter is both a place to hang out and an art piece to admire as the light travels through the different colored panes washing over the ground and the occupants.

The structure can be almost inverted using the parameters to create more of an elegant art piece that people can admire and explore. I explored this option as a final design for this pavilion but ultimately found the upright design to be more inviting and welcoming than the inverted option due to the low center. I also explored the thickness up the posts and ultimately chose the thickness that I did because I was confident that the posts would be sturdy but not provide too much of an obstruction to the rest of the structure or its entrances. The degree of arching can also be changed using the parameters. I chose a degree that gave the pavilion a magical circus vibe while still remaining representative of a parachute. The number of roof sections can also be changed in multiples of 4 to keep the color pattern consistent. By changing this parameter I was able to explore which amount seemed balanced and not so crowded with posts on the ground. Overall the parameters helped me to be able to experiment with the overall shape and tweak it to match my vision.
