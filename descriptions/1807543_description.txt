My design is based on the strong foundations that students build over their life. The three pillars on each side are made of steel to represent that strength. The pillars on one side recommend the foundations that students built to get here and are to be interpreted on a personal basis. No matter who you are and whether they represent family, friends, high school, hobbies, sports or faith they all funnel into the central pillar representing the present (university life). The three opposing pillars represent the future and the pillars that you can build off of your university experience. The timber roof is a representation of naturality in knowledge and a reminder of the knowledge that future growth will stem from. The design is meant to provoke reflection and optimistic intrigue as students take their first steps into the real world.

Parametric controls were a considerable influence on the design. Adjusting the steel pillars made me realize that I wanted to make them bigger than originally thought as to further symbolize strength and stability.
