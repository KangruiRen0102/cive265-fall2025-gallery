In my pavilion structure, it is inspired by the trusses I see in the Donadeo building at the University of Alberta on the seventh floor. I noticed these trusses coming from the floor to the roof. That inspired me to have angled trusses that were more appealing to me. I designed the trusses at an angle so that pedestrians could use my structure as a resting stop by leaning on the diagonal trusses. Additionally, I designed it as a circular roof because I wanted it to represent the “O” in the WOW abbreviation. Therefore, putting this structure in between two W structures or letters would make my design much more meaningful. 

I used number sliders to control the radius of my bottom foundation and my circular roof. Additionally, I used a number slider to control the distance between my foundation and roof. Then, I used a number slider to control my rod radius parameter for my angled rod pillars. Adjusting the parameters for the foundation and circular roof allowed me to realize a wider roof than the foundation is more aesthetically pleasing. All this adjustment of parametric controls made me realize that thinner pillars than foundations look better. Additionally, the adjustment of parameters made me realize that proportions of the height of the pavilion to the width mattered if it were to be appealing. Moreover, the rod radius parameter was adjusted to not be too thick as it would be unpleasant.
