The design concept mainly focuses on creating an inviting, memorable space that supports the atmosphere of Welcome Week. My pavilion uses radial, dome-like structure to create a sense of arrival and give pedestrians/students a clear landmark on campus. As people walk underneath the pavilion, the gradual upward curve and pattern created by the rods create this feeling of openness and uplift. The experience is supposed to be welcoming and encouraging students to gather, take a break, and interact. Through combining structural clarity in a more expressive form the pavilion aims to create a sense of community during a pretty important moment where brand new students transition to university. I used parametric controls to explore the pavilion’s form by connecting geometric elements such as radial rods, ring segments, and the dome surface to adjustable variables. Parameters such as the number of radial rods, dome height, and beam diameter let the model regenerate instantly which allows me to test different structural forms. Changing these parameters helped me see how the pavilion changes with change; for instance, increasing the radial number creates a tighter and more enclosed pattern, while less producing a lighter more open structure. Then because rod placement was tied to the timber beam midpoints, the system stayed coherent even as the values were changed, therefore keeping geometry consistent with the design intent. Overall, the parametric setup allowed for quick iteration and refinement which helped me arrive at a pavilion form that balanced what I wanted, visual clarity, and the intended spatial experience. Which was an open in which people are able to communicate and create connections.
