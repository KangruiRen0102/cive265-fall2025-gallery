This design is meant to provide students with an area to escape the sun while still being able to socialize with others and make new friendships to start the year off strong. The design is created so that there is a solid cover overtop that blocks out the sun and creates a cooler area while the poles on the side are used to block out the sun from side angles while still allowing an open concept. The experience this pavilion is designed to bring is a welcoming area. This welcoming feeling is mainly meant to be shown in ways such as creating a sense of community with the people and a sense of relaxation with the shade.
The first parametric design I used was the steel rods being able to change their radius exponentially, this is for the purpose of multiple things. The first reason is adding support to the structure because having thicker rods is gonna be safer and more studier. The second reason is for design looks as it adds a different more complex look to the structure. Also the thickness of the rods being able to change allows for more sun blockage with a thicker rod. The next parametric design that was created was then the wood support platform as the thickness is able to change allowing for a safer structure because it can be adjusted so the weight isn't too much for the support beams below but still sturdy enough to hold everything together. The second last thing I did was make the arches radius change so it could create thicker beams. This is for the purpose of being able to withstand wind gusts and also not put too much pressure on the below supporting parts with its mass. Lastly I made parametric controls for all the circular rods on the roof, this purpose was also to create a more safe structure. These parameters furthermore create the welcoming community and relaxing feeling in the pavilion through safety, as well as the main support rods being able to change creates more shade making it more relaxing.
