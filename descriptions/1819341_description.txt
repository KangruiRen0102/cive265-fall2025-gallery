1. Design Concept and User Experience:
The Biomorphic Canopy is designed to transform the UAlberta Quad into an inviting, fluid, and dynamic shelter for the Week of Welcome (WOW). The design rationale emphasizes biomimicry and fluidity, moving away from rigid, institutional lines to create a structure resembling a cresting wave or woven ribs. I want pedestrians to experience a sense of community, relaxation, and discovery. The high central apex and unique, curving form act as a striking visual landmark, creating a clear sense of arrival and excitement for new students entering the space. The structure's porosity offers necessary shade and rain protection, facilitating gathering.
2. Parametric Controls and Geometric Logic:
My form aligns with the rationale through the precise use of five critical parameters. Geometry was explored by tinkering with functions (sin, cos, etc) and frequency, ensuring complex quantitative behavior matched the fluid concept. The pavilion's complex topology is achieved by having each Timber Beam instance evolve: it starts as a single arch and gradually splits into a double-vaulted structure down the tunnel length. This makes every beam unique. I used the Wave Frequency slider to explore different textures, settling on a frequency that gives the ribs a slight woven ripple, enhancing the natural aesthetic. The Adaptive Columns were essential for feasibility, as they dynamically calculate the roof's variable height to ensure a perfect connection.
3. Class and Material Specification:
The pavilion is defined by two Python classes and uses distinct materials. Class 1 (Series of Instances): Timber Beams (Wood). Class 2 (Series of Instances): Roof Panels (Polycarbonate). The Tapered Columns (Steel/Concrete) provide the adaptive support. All volumes are calculated via Python methods and displayed in Watch nodes, verifying material quantity accuracy.
