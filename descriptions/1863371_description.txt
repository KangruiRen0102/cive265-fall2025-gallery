The Solar Arch was designed as a net-zero carbon pavilion to awe and inspire the new incoming students at the UofA. Built from Canadian spruce columns and solar curtains from the design team Inside Outside. The solar arch not only provides shade and an auditorium for outdoor music, but it can harness the sun’s energy and feed power back into the grid. Pedestrians will feel a sense of grandeur from the large span of the timber columns and be intrigued by the way it seems to defy gravity as the columns almost “float” in space. Materials were chosen based on their sustainable features and the structure was designed based on the curvature in the North Saskatchewan River that flows beside the campus. Especially considering the week of welcome, this pavilion will inspire students to study the forces this structure must resist as well as the beauty in design with natural and sustainable materials. Parametric controls used include the rib count, rib radius, panel thickness, and sliders to seamlessly adjust the forms and size of the structure. Adjustment to these parameters enables tests for optimal performance, openness, and visual appearances; directly showing how geometric changes impact the structure and material use. Increasing rib count made the pavilion more intricate and provided greater structural stability. Adjustments made in the rib radius balanced the structural integrity with the transparency in the solar curtain, this optimized the amount of solar capacity in the curtain with timber size. This iterative process ensured that the final design met both aesthetic and practical requirements, allowing fine tune adjustments in quality, structure, and materials to best suit the site conditions.
