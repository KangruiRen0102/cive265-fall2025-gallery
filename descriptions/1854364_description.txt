For Week of Welcome, the intention was to create a structure that feels welcoming and comfortable while still being prominent enough to signal a place of arrival. Because of this, the pavilion is inspired by the natural form of a mushroom, featuring a smooth steel dome supported by several curved steel columns. Its gentle curves help achieve a natural feel. However, its large size and metallic material also allow it to stand out, creating a strong visual presence in the Quad. From a distance, it captures attention. Once inside, it feels comfortable and easy to gather in. The combination of an organic form with the steel materials emphasizes both its natural inspiration and its role as a memorable landmark.

The pavilion is circular with benches around the edge, encouraging visitors to face a shared center point. This layout promotes social interaction, a key part of WoW. The open stem formed by the curved columns provides clear views through the structure, creating a sense of openness. The dome provides shade while letting in light from the sides, balancing a sense of shelter with openness. The height, curvature, and spacing of the columns were carefully considered to guide movement and focus attention both inside and outside the pavilion.

The pavilion’s form was refined using many parametric controls. By adjusting several parameters relating to the size, shape, and number of individual components (columns, dome, base, and benches), I explored and refined a complex organic shape. This process involved balancing these components to achieve proportions, openness, and visual qualities that met both design intentions and user experience. Each parameter change influenced multiple aspects of the pavilion, allowing me to fine-tune how it is perceived from a distance, how people move through it, and how it feels inside. This parametric approach ensured the pavilion remained coherent, functional, and buildable while creating a space that is visually striking and welcoming.
