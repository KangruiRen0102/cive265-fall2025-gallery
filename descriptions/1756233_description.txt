1.) 
My pavilion, The Summer's End Shelter, is based on a simple, open-air structure that is inspired by the atmosphere of a summer campsite and gathering spaces found in parks and natural sites. My approach was to create a welcoming and comfortable point of arrival during the Week of Welcome. I aim to bring together shelter, openness, and transition, which reflects the shift from the summer break into the start of the year. 

I.) I aspire for pedestrians to feel a sense of ease and invitation when approaching and entering the pavilion. The open framework allows individuals to walk inside from any direction, thereby creating a casual and relaxed environment. The repeating beams are meant to be parallel with the calming and natural structures at campsites. This overall creates an uncluttered space where students can meet in a relaxing and familiar environment during the Week of Welcome.

II.) The Week of Welcome is centered on arrival, community-building, and helping new students become more accustomed to the campus. My pavilion design is in parallel with the end of summer and the beginning of a new journey. Moreover, the structure creates a central, neutral gathering spot where students can comfortably rest, socialize, and pass through. The design concept supports relaxation, openness, and connection which are all qualities that are essential during welcoming events. 

2.) 
I used the pavilion's length, width, roof height, and frame count as parametric controls to explore different design possibilities and find a fitting design for a pavilion. Adjusting the length and width helped me test how open or communal the area felt. Changing the roof height allowed me to find the right balance between a comfortable shelter space and an open, welcoming atmosphere. Moreover, modifying the frame count helped me find a balance between providing enough structural support, and also achieving a more natural, open area similar to campsite structures.
