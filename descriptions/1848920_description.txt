I chose this design because, the two main features of a pavilion are to provide shade and also a place where people can gather under it. With those two factors in mind I cam up with a design that maximizes the space for people under the roof while still being open and welcoming for people walking by. The "Octa" part of the name is from the octagonal shape of the overall shape, "vault" comes from the vaulted roof panels.
