The Gateway to Discovery is A sculptural pavilion that invites students and visitors to step beneath its soaring U-shaped beams, symbolizing the journey of learning and exploration at the University of Alberta. Its open, uplifting form frames the sky above, inspiring curiosity, connection, and the pursuit of knowledge during the week of welcome. The pavilion is both elegantly simple and creatively detailed. The structure almost looks empty without the students that would make it lively, and at the same time its roof is an intricately shaped panel of concrete beams. 

This design started with parametric controls that created a sinusoidal roof plane, peaked in the middle. I then used it to visualize how it works overall, and then built classes to allow of fine tuning it both for cost/structural reasons and for appearance. the beams are hollow with inside and outside fillets for manufacturability, and have a -1 value on the slider allowing them to be fully filled in, and variable dimensions, reduced down to one slider since it has to be easy enough to change, not so complicated that there are 10 different inputs to mangle. The U shape of the roof is parametrized so that I could look at what size of U is detailed enough to be intricate while being elegantly simple from far away. It took a bit of fine-tuning to get that balance. I also parametrized the angle of the A frame, since the angle needs to try and appear like an A. 

This gate also takes inspiration from the Japanese Tori gates, which separate the homes of the kami (gods/deities) from everyday life. Passing through one you are expected to bow, showing respect for the god that resides there. The university is similarly important and sacred to the researchers and professors that have the opportunity to work there.
