i) The overall experience I want pedestrians to have is one of shelter and a sense of security from the roof above them, as well as a sense of awe from the pavilions impressive curves and overall shape. 
ii) I think this shape would be perfect for the week of welcome, because as I stated before it’s wavy roof creates a sense of security and a feeling of safety for those new to the university, while the exterior curves wave up and down, almost as though they are waving at newcomers, welcoming them to their new school!

The most important parametric controls that I experimented with were the number of waves in the exterior curves of the structure, and the rotation angle for the wooden “blinds” that span the middle of the structure. For the wave parameter, I knew that it would be easiest to program the logic for the resulting shapes if there was only one overall arch, however I thought that making it possible to add more cycles to the steel curve was really important to create that waving and welcoming effect that I mentioned above. Adjusting this parameter was initially difficult as it would cause the “blinds” that I created between the curves to twist and contort to the point that the program couldn’t properly generate the solids, but eventually I found a solution that uses various vectors to create the blinds based on 4 input points. The blind rotation angle parameter basically allows the user to rotate every blind along it’s axis, leading to different interesting and beautiful results. With no rotation, the blinds essentially form a smooth roof across the structure, which is not ideal as it blocks out most light and potentially even causes the pavilion to feel claustrophobic. However, when we increase the angle, the blinds open up and more light enters the interior, which makes the space feel more open and welcoming for users. I think being able to adjust hypothetical user experience so drastically with this one parameter is very powerful!
