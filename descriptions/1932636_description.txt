The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ pavilion was conceptualized with the primary purpose of delivering an experience that was not only welcoming but also comfortable and memorable to the students during the Week of Welcome. Its round layout and the airy setup of the wooden columns were deliberate choices made to permit access from any direction, thus facilitating the pedestrian flow that is quite heavy, while also promoting social interaction. The area created by the spacing of the columns serves as a semi-open gathering spot where students can rest, meet friends, or get their bearings on campus. The wood was chosen because of its warm and inviting nature, which is characteristic of many types of wood, making the pavilion feel friendly. Whereas the steel roof serves as a visual marker that can be noticed from a distance, these features individually contribute to forming a sense of arrival and community. Together, these features create a sense of arrival and community in a new setting, while also providing comfort and protection from the sun.

Parametric controls largely influenced the final shape of the pavilion. Various parameters, such as the number of columns, radius, height, and roof geometry, were controlled through sliders, thereby speeding up the process of testing changes in enclosure, visibility, and openness with every change. For example, adding more columns helped define the space better, and a smaller number of columns lightened up the space and made it look more open. The adjustment of the pavilion radius changed the number of students who could gather together comfortably, and changing the roof height showed either the structure's prominence or its intimacy. These parameters provide the means to the pavilion's perfection, culminating in a welcoming, functional landmark that supports orientation, gathering, and community building during the Week of Welcome.
