Ive designed a very simple pavilion students could use as a shelter from the sun or rain, or an area to set up for a club program or even set up chairs and just hang out and have fun. I designed the structure this simple for faster construction and it gives the students a nice foundation to create whatever kind of space they would like. For example students can set up booths on the sides closest to the walkways in order to attract other students to come see what their club is about or whatever product they are selling. 

I used parametric controls to give my pavilion a rectangular shape , but since i have lsideres the final design can be tweaked to however the builder would like. Using the python script node the new volumes would be automatically recalculated and given to us. This parametric approach ensured the final design remained flexible,and responsive to both functional and experiential goals.
