The pavilion is a calm, welcoming space where students can slow down, take a break, and connect with others during the Week of Welcome. Students can gather, rest between activities, or meet new people in a comfortable setting. Its shallow dome form provides shade while remaining open to the campus environment.
Adjustable parameters allowed me to easily modify proportions of different elements such as dome height, beam width, and various other aspects. Sliders helped test how different configurations affected comfort, shading quality, and spatial openness.
