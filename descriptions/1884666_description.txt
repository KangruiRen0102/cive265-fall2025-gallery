My design is based on the monkey bars we used to swing on as kids. I was inspired by monkey bars as I used to love to swing on them as a kid and I wanted my design to bring out a nostalgic vibe. My design also has cuboids at the base for seating for passers by or visitors. The design might also look slight like an optical elusion but that is on purpose, as I also wanted my pavilion to have a abstract art type of look. Hopefully you will like my pavilion and thank you
