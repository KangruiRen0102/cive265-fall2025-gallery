The “Tension Sphere” Pavilion (Global Nexus)

Design Concept and User Experience (WOW Context):

The Tension Sphere pavilion is envisioned as a clean, minimalist landmark that highlights the U of A’s global identity. A Gold Sphere (Material A), shaped as an abstract Earth, is lifted by four angled Green Columns (Material B). Using the university’s colours ties the idea together—global reach supported by strong campus roots.

i) Desired User Experience:
The pavilion is meant to make people feel like they’ve arrived somewhere meaningful. The raised Gold Sphere naturally draws the eye, hinting at the university’s diverse and international community. As people walk underneath this “Global Nexus,” they enter a small, sheltered gathering place. The angled columns represent the supportive networks—students, mentors, faculty and the staff—that elevate the community.

ii) Rationale for WOW:
The Gold Sphere symbolizes global connection and possibility, while the four Green Columns anchor that vision in stability and support. Together, they create a memorable and easily recognizable focal point on the Quad, reinforcing the idea of unity and shared community, no matter where someone comes from.

Parametric Controls and Design Refinement:

The pavilion’s geometry is driven by four main parameters:

P1: Sphere Radius (R_Ball): Controls the size and visual emphasis of the sphere.
P2: Column Height (H_Col): Determines how high the sphere sits, shaping whether the space beneath feels open and airy or more intimate.
P3: Column Radius (R_Col): Adjusts how strong, stable, or slender the columns appear.
P4: Angle Spread (X_Spread): Sets the inclination of the columns, changing how much sheltered space forms underneath.

Carefully adjusting these parameters helped refine the balance between visual impact, spatial comfort, and material efficiency, resulting in a pavilion that feels intentional, expressive, and clear in its message.
