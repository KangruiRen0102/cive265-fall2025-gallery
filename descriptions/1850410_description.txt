The design for the University of Alberta's Week of Welcome pavilion is fundamentally concerned with leveraging geometry to create a functional and welcoming space that effectively addresses the high-traffic, transitional nature of the event. My primary objective was to construct an architectural statement that defines the experience of arrival and successfully encourages community formation. The specific form chosen—the ruled surface—was selected because it visually narrates the WoW experience itself. The structure is generated by continuous, straight-line generators that connect two non-parallel curved boundaries (the ground ellipse and the high crest). These individual straight lines represent the distinct paths and trajectories of incoming students, which ultimately converge to form a unified, coherent, and beautiful whole, symbolizing the cohesive nature of the university community. This visual effect ensures the space feels lively and engaging, consistent with the spirit of the event. The idea of this specific, non-orthogonal geometry was entirely dependent on the parametric control systems I developed using the Dynamo visual programming environment. This methodology allowed me to define the architecture not with fixed dimensions, but with variables, to optimize both the visual impact and the functional criteria. The critical parameter was the density of the ruled line generators. This parameter directly controls the structure's material rhythm and visual transparency. A low number of lines (a sparse count) left the structure feeling incomplete and offered insufficient shade. A high number of lines created visual occlusion, negating the required transparency. Through a series of tests, I found the optimal density—the number of lines necessary to balance light filtration with structural expression.
