During the process of coming up with a design. I figured something that blends in with its surroundings and eliminates the idea of a man-made structure could create an area of relaxation and provide a break from the loud noises a city or work has. From that thought, a tree had come to mind, and it is a perfect idea to give a space that takes away the noise of a city. The Lumber pillars give the look of a tree trunk, and the Steel ring above provides the coverage of leaves in capturing the space and leaving a covered pavilion that blends in with nature. The multiple different entry ways open the space up and provide an accepting look and the feel of getting leaf cover by a tree in any direction. The bench provides a resting place similar to a squirrel in a tree, a safe, warm place to keep people warm and covered from weather conditions. The parametric controls helped open up and figure out the best possible way to create that natural tree look. Changing the radius of the steel cylinder provides the option for more or less tree cover, roof height providing the option for different styles of trees, and leaf height. As well as the number of lumber trucks and their thickness (rib count, rib size). Ultimately, the design is to resemble nature and give a space away from the noise. ( During the Python code, I had used ChatGPT to help me fix and indicate what different functions mean.)
