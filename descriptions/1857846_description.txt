My pavilion creates a calm and sheltered space in the middle of the Week of Welcome. I used a grid of steel columns and perimeter walls to create a rectangular room, and a curved roof to give it a cathedral vibe. The low wall height, combined with no windows, separates the pavilion from other buildings on campus from the busy campus. In conclusion, my pavilion provides a comfortable, semi-enclosed space that reads as a clear gateway and gathering point.
Parametric controls entirely control the pavilion's design. Sliders for pavilion length, width, and the number of columns in the X and Y directions control the overall footprint, ensuring it stays within the 10 x 10m limit. The volume of the pavilion is based on the height of the columns and the curvature of the roof. Increasing height and curvature create a more cathedral-like space, while lower values make the pavilion feel calmer. Separate sliders for column radius, rib thickness, and wall height allowed me to balance structural expression with openness.
Two Python classes, SteelColumn and WoodRib, generate the steel frame and curved roof ribs as a series of instances. Since all the elements are parameter-based, I could quickly test multiple proportions and densities, which helped me refine a design that is spacious while remaining buildable.
