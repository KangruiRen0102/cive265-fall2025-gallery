As many people know, the weather is always changing, especially here in Edmonton. Which is why the design in this pavilion is special and convenient. In the summer, you can relax and take a seat on the cool concrete and feel the warmth of the sun. This way, you are never too hot or too cold on warm temperature days. This pavilion works also well in the winter, the strong gusts of wind will disperse due to the rectangular rod wall. This will eliminate any harsh winds while inside. An additional feature of this pavilion is privacy. It’s the midway between enough privacy that will allow a group of people to hang out in isolation and noticeable for others to know that there's people in there. The kind of experience I want for pedestrians is to utilize this space for escape for undesired weather plus secluded area for group hangouts. In consideration of Week of Welcome, the pavilion will fuel the emotion of relaxation.

One major parametric control is the width of the walls. The wall is made up of rectangular rods made of steel. Depending on desired privacy, the widths can be adjusted via a number slider to make more/less privacy. The higher the number, the more privacy of the walls; elimination of gaps between the rods. Giving this adjustment will allow the designer to choose how they want pedestrians to experience the pavilion. Another parametric control is the stairway. Not only is there one control, but four controls; tread, width, riser, and number of risers. This is essential because many people cannot use stairs due to impairments. For example, elderly have many physical disabilities and it’s possible to reduce that by making the tread smaller, so they can take smaller steps. Another example would be to add more steps so more people could fit, if that's the goal. Allowing the adjustment of these parameters helps to define the overall design of the pavilion. It’s essential to have choices because if redesigning is necessary, the process will be very efficient.
