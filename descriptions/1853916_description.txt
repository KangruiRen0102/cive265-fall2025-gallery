The pavilion’s design is inspired by the symbolism of protection, balance, and harmony. The name is a combination of the Arabic word Salam which means peace and Nexus which refers to a central point where different elements meet. The two curved timber walls gracefully wrap around the space, creating an inviting and sheltered environment that feels like a personal sanctuary. People experience a sense of arrival as they pass through this welcoming refuge, living a red carpet moment. Inside, the angled columns form a mystical canopy that filters light and frames views leaving sights in wonder and awe. The varying heights of the columns symbolize the coming together of diverse perspectives and values, reflecting a balanced community. In the center, sturdy steel columns unite the timber family, conveying strength and unity while the concrete foundation that the pavilion sits on brings the community together on stage. During Week of Welcome, the pavilion serves as a vibrant social hub that encourages relaxation, connection, and discovery. It invites students to gather, explore, and engage with university life in a space that hugs and inspires. Whether used for hangouts, solo time, studying, or lively events, the pavilion fosters a strong sense of belonging. Parametric controls were integral to refining the pavilion’s form to meet different goals. By adjusting angles, heights, radii, positions, and quantities, the pavilion interacts with light, sight, and movement differently. Changing the column angles influenced openness and enclosure of the space. Varying the column heights introduced rhythm and aesthetics while reinforcing the concept of diversity and balance. Modifying the radius and position allowed the pavilion’s size to be best suitable for various design goals. ultimately, the pavilion’s purpose is to create a welcoming, harmonious space that excites and unites people through their stages in university life.
