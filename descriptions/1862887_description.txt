Design Concept and Experience
The Quad Grove Pavilion in the UofA Main Quad is envisioned as a calm, welcoming space where students can pause during Week of Welcome. Its circular form makes it easy to approach from any direction, encouraging spontaneous gathering. Angled ribs, central trees, and a low canopy of greenery soften the atmosphere, creating a retreat from the busy campus surroundings.
A broad roof overhang ensures consistent shade, while the open layout invites students to sit, socialize, and rest together under one shared structure. The diagonal steel braces give the pavilion a distinctive character without compromising the spaciousness inside. At its core, the design aims to foster comfort, community, and a sense of arrival at the start of the academic year.
Use of Parametric Controls
The design was guided by parameters such as enclosure, openness, and structural rhythm, specifically rib count, rib angle, pavilion height, and footing size. Adjusting the rib angle proved especially important: shallow ribs created a wide, airy feel, while steeper angles strengthened the structure. The diagonal ribs also reinforced stability against lateral forces, improving resistance to snow and wind, an essential consideration for Alberta’s climate.
Other parameters helped position solar panels to maximize exposure through the central roof aperture. These controls allowed rapid exploration of structural, environmental, and spatial variations, ultimately shaping a pavilion that balances user comfort with durability and performance.
Sustainability
Sustainability is woven into the design. Solar panels provide off‑grid lighting, while the angled roof overhang reduces direct summer heat. Integrated planters with trees add natural shading and passive cooling. Material use was minimized through parametric modeling, lowering embodied carbon while maintaining strength. Together, these strategies create a pavilion that is environmentally responsible as well as inviting.
