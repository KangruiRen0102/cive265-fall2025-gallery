My design for the “Week of Welcome” pavilion is meant for students to feel comfortable and excited when they first step onto the grounds. I tried to steer away from the idea of ambivalence students tend to feel when starting their first, or new, year of university. Because of this uncertainty, I went with a more simple and calming design so students do not have to feel that way when walking onto campus. Ideally, where the hole is cut, we’d plant a tree. This would symbolize new growth and opportunities. I wanted the spiral pillars to resemble staircases because throughout a student's career, there are many steps that need to be taken to get where they want to be, and university is one of the most important ones. The different sizes in the pillars, and number of blocks, represent each individual student because no matter the goal, each person takes their own path at their own pace with a variety of different steps. This is why I believe my design not only calms the students but also inspires them to be the best they can. 
As for the geometric and technical design, I used number sliders to control a variety of parameters in my design. I had two that helped control how the foundation of my design looked and ultimately affected the calculations of the volume for it as well. One slider was for controlling how tall the block that would cut through my ellipse would be, as the other was for the radius of the cylinder that cut through the ellipse as well. I had similar controls for the twisted towers. Since the towers each have different widths, lengths, angles, and floor counts, they needed the number sliders to make it easier to find the perfect ratio for each. Finally, I had number sliders for the distance between each cylinder and for the radius of the cylinders. Each slider helped me create the perfect ratios for each specific design of the pavilion.
