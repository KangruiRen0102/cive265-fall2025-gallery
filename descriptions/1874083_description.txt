This pavilion is a parametric, pentagonal-inspired structure composed of repetitive timber portal frames supporting a lightweight glass roof on one side. The wooden frames define both the structure and the spatial rhythm of the pavilion, creating a semi-enclosed gathering space that remains visually open. Glass panels are applied only to one slope of the roof to introduce asymmetry, enhance daylight penetration, and emphasize the contrast between solid wood and transparent glazing. The model is fully parametric: the number of frames is controlled by the frame count slider, spacing is controlled by frame spacing, and material dimensions are governed by the timber width and depth parameters. The glass thickness is independently controlled using a glass thickness slider, which directly affects the computed glass volume. Both wood and glass material volumes are calculated through custom Python classes, allowing real-time feedback as parameters are adjusted.
