“The Welcome Hangar Pavilion” is inspired by an aircraft hangar and is designed as a low, sweeping shell that creates a clear passage through the center of the Quad. The curved timber arches and folded steel panels create a sense of entering an airfield hangar, turning the Week of Welcome path into a short “runway” that students walk along as they arrive on campus - as if they are landing at their new home! Visitors experience a gradual transition from open sky to a more enclosed, protective canopy, emulating the feeling of moving from outside the university to being welcomed within its community. Open ends and moderate height keep sightlines clear so that the pavilion remains welcoming rather than intimidating. This design was inspired by my passion for aviation and experience as a private pilot, as well as the practical aspect of being a shelter from the elements if necessary.

Parametric controls were used to modify this design, allowing for a very basic aircraft hangar design at a low complexity setting or a wild design at a high complexity setting. The number of timber arches and the spacing between them controls the size of the pavilion as well as its structural integrity. A design with more arches and less spacing between arches allows for maximum load capacity, and thus has the greatest integrity. The maximum arch height slider adjusts the hangar profile, from a low protective shell to a taller, more dramatic arch that can be seen across the Quad. Arch complexity varies the curvature, allowing exploration from simple “semi-oval” forms to more undulating surfaces that catch light differently throughout the day. Finally, steel panel thickness governs the visual weight of the cladding and the material volume calculations. By iteratively adjusting these parameters, the pavilion was refined to balance enclosure and openness, producing a clear, legible hangar-like form that supports orientation, excitement, and a shared sense of arrival during Week of Welcome.
