The pavilion is conceived as a symbolic crown, expressing the idea that pursuing education is one of the highest honors. The design aims to make pedestrians feel empowered, valued, and proud as they pass through or around it. Much like a crown signifies achievement and nobility, this pavilion communicates that being part of the university is not simply a responsibility, but a privilege of great importance. As for the Week of Welcome, this crown creates a sense of arrival and belonging. The crown encourages new students to “begin with the end in mind,” seeing their academic path as something to hold with pride rather than doubt. 
Parametric controls played a significant role in shaping the pavilion. Sliders controlling the bending amount and bending position of each pillar allowed for exploration of curvature, height, and shape, until the structure resembled an elegant, refined crown. The connector ring parameters (vertical and horizontal thickness) were equally as crucial for making the jewel of the crown as stable as possible, thus increasing realism. Without the ring, the jewel would only touch the pillars at a tangential area, making it less stable, especially if the ball is heavy.
