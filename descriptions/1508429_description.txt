My pavilion design creates a warm gathering space for new students to sit, converse, and connect. The circular layout symbolizes inclusiveness and unity, welcoming students into the campus community.
The central seating area encourages students to sit in a circle, facilitating social interaction. The surrounding spiraling columns and spheres represent students' progressive journey, climbing toward academic excellence and reaching scholarly heights. The flower-like canopy above symbolizes growth toward light, embodying youthful vitality and bright futures.
The design incorporates yellow and green, showcasing the University of Alberta's distinctive colors. During Welcome Week, this pavilion:
• Provides a clear gathering landmark
• Creates belonging and community atmosphere
• Encourages exploration through open structure
• Establishes campus identity through school colors
The pavilion offers pedestrians an experience of arrival, relaxation, and community, where new students find respite, engage in conversations, and feel excitement about their university journey.

Parametric Controls:
Parametric design enabled rapid exploration of design possibilities and refinement through parameter adjustments.
Key Parameters:
1. Pavilion Height (2700-3300mm): Controls vertical scale and enclosure, affecting spatial experience and comfort.
2. Bottom Circle Width (3000-3600mm): Determines footprint and capacity, influencing congregation space.
3. Column and Sphere Dimensions: Adjustable thickness refines structural expression and visual weight.
4. Material Volume: Updates automatically with parameter changes, enabling optimization of structural efficiency.
Through iterative adjustments, I achieved a form aligning with my design rationale. Testing different heights helped find optimal balance between openness and shelter. Adjusting base width ensured adequate space for interactions while maintaining intimacy.
