The Orbital Pavilion is a small gathering space designed for the Week of Welcome, inspired by the James Webb Space Telescope. The overall form is circular to encourage movement into the center and to create a welcoming, open atmosphere for students arriving on campus. The pavilion fits within the required 10 m by 10 m footprint and uses a clear, readable layout so visitors can easily enter from any direction.
The roof surface is shaped by a set of sloping panels that meet at a small opening in the middle. This gives the pavilion shade while still allowing sunlight to reach the ground. The roof shape was developed through parametric controls for height, panel thickness, pavilion radius, and the number of columns. Adjusting these sliders allowed me to study how the structure changes in openness, proportion, and overall feel while keeping everything regenerating properly.
Steel columns form the outer ring and support the roof. A circular railing outlines the space and provides a light visual boundary without blocking movement. The pattern of the columns and the symmetry of the roof give the structure a simple but recognizable appearance that works well as a meeting point during campus events.
Two Python classes were used to organize the components. One represents the steel columns and computes their volume. The other represents the roof panels and calculates their material thickness and volume. A series of instances of the column class was created around the pavilion, and all quantities update automatically when parameters change. This keeps the design consistent and allows material take-offs to stay accurate.
