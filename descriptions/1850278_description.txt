I landed on this design through searching wave pavillions, I liked the concept but most looked almost identical which was kind of odd to me since such an abstract shape has so many possibilities, after playing around with the pramaters for wave shape and height, I landed on this, I found inspiration from it from the Sydney opera house, with it's large powerful waves hanging over the entrance. For the week of welcome I wanted this to have a bit of a divider to allow some privacy and maybe booths on each side, I designed this with the thought what I would want during a hot day, some shade and privacy, but not to the point where I am secluded from the other side. Overall by changing the parameters it assisted in developing my design philosophy and understanding the limits and potential of my design.
