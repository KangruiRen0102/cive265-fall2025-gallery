The Convergence Canopy represents a dynamic and unique welcoming shelter through its slanted columns and peaked roof. Steel columns lean inward from a circular perimeter, converging toward a central aluminum roof. This geometry creates an embracing atmosphere while maintaining openness at eye level.
Students experience the pavilion as both functional shelter and inspiring architecture. The columns guide the eye upward, creating a sense of gathering and unity, symbolizing how diverse students have shared goals. The peaked roof provides weather protection and serves as a visual landmark across the quad, naturally drawing students toward it as a meeting point. The futuristic aesthetic aligns with the Week of Welcome's message of new beginnings, offering security and belonging.
The design was explored through five key parameters that work together to create the final form:
Number of Columns (Range: 4-12): Settled on 8 columns, balancing coverage, integrity, and visual lightness.
Roof Height (Range: 3000-6000 mm): Settled on 4000 mm, making the pavilion feel large and welcoming without being overwhelming.
Pavilion Size (Range: 6000-9000 mm): Settled on an 8000 mm diameter that provides coverage for 20-25 people comfortably.
Peak Height (Range: 0-2000 mm): Settled on 1500 mm to transform a simple roof into a major attention grabber that emphasizes the convergence concept.
Column Lean Factor (Range: 0.45-1): Settled on 0.8 because this amount of lean creates a bold, contemporary look while maintaining structural integrity toward the central peak they support.
Through parametric controls, I found that balanced, moderate values work best. The combination of Column Lean and Peak Height was the most important.
