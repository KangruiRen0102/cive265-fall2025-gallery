“The Rise” is built around the idea of growth and moving upwards, something every student experiences at the University of Alberta. The green and gold colour scheme ties directly to the U of A identity, and the twisted form creates a sense of motion that draws people in. At the top, the crown shaped petals represent the goals students work toward and the sense of achievement that comes from rising through challenges. For Week of Welcome, the pavilion is meant to feel like a welcoming first impression on campus. The twisting shell forms an open but defined space where people can pause, meet one another, and take in their surroundings. It isn’t a shelter, but rather a landmark which aims to reflect a sense of community energy of the first week back and encourages students to keep rising towards their goals. Parametric controls shaped almost every part of the pavilion. Adjusting variables like twist amount, height, petal lift, fence wave pattern, and railing offset helped test how different forms influenced the experience of the space. Increasing the twist emphasized the upward motion, changing the petal height affected how “celebratory” the crown felt, and modifying the fence wave amplitude helped balance openness with definition. These parameters made it easy to explore many versions of the design and select a form that aligned with the concept I had in mind. The final version keeps the upward flow of “The Rise,” highlights the U of A colours, and creates a welcoming experience that fits the spirit of Week of Welcome.
