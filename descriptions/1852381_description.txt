The Welcoming Spire is designed as a small but visually striking marker that creates a sense of arrival and excitement for new and returning students during the week of welcome, serving as a recognizable point where WoW volunteers can comfortably hand out flyers and greet students. The paired cones create a clear vertical landmark that draws attention from a distance, while the ring of angled cylinders forms a visually energetic perimeter that signals activity without functioning as a fully enclosed gathering space. Instead, the pavilion acts as a momentary pause point, something students walk past, notice, and associate with the university in the opening weeks of the academic year. Parametric controls were essential in shaping the welcoming spire adjusting the base and upper radii helped determine how visually open the structure appears from different approach angles; modifying the overall height and cone-apex height allowed me to tune the balance between being a small, compact structure to save space, or a large landmark that draws eyes from across the quad. Additionally, varying the number and radius of cylinders allows for variation in how much cover is given within the structure, either providing shade for the volunteers, or keeping the sides open to create a more natural feel. Through iterating with these parameters, I arrived at a compact form that stands out as a vibrant, temporary landmark ideal for students during the Week of Welcome.
