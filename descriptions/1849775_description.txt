When people walk under my pavilion, I want them to feel a sense of belonging and safety. During the week of welcome, incoming university students may feel out of place and unfamiliar with the environment, but these feelings of belonging and safety that are projected by the pavilion help make the students feel welcome. I altered five parameters: Column Radius, Height, Curvature Amplitude, Number of columns in the X direction, and Number of columns in the Y direction. There had to be a perfect balance of these parameters to project the feeling of belonging and safety; if I added too many columns or the height of the pavilion was too low, the students may feel overly trapped as opposed to feeling safe. Additionally, having a roof that was too flat would likely project an uninviting feeling as opposed to a sense of belonging. Adjusting parameters with the parametric controls in my design helped me alter various structural and aesthetic aspects of my design efficiently with sliders, as opposed to rebuilding the structure multiple times with various dimensions to see what works. An example of the use of this is altering the radius of the columns, resulting in an increased load capacity of the pavilion and an increase in the volume of the cylinders.
