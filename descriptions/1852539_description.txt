Most people have a lamp next to their bed or on their desk. We leave it on before going to bed or during late night study sessions. This “lamp” design gives that comfort vibe; a sense of home. In the week of welcome many students are going to come from places outside the city of Edmonton and being homesick is very common. Many students are not from the city therefore they are living away from their home, family, and friends. So I based my design to have a nostalgic feel. When students walk past this design they will remember home and associate it with their home and their new home away from home, the University of Alberta. This architectural design mixes home with academics. The lamp-like design would give a silhouette of home while the architectural design would give a feeling of scholarship. To build a sense of community in the week of welcome I designed it with a short cylinder on its base to serve as a seat. This way people and friends can sit together and hang out or make new friends. I designed this with the intention of it becoming the “spot” where people meet up and a landmark that is part of the university’s identity. I also designed it with a lightbulb-like sphere about its center. It will serve as a light of hope during the dark times when staying late on campus to study. I used the parametric controls to change the height of the roof to what was the most visually pleasing. It was also used to change the amount of cables to 117 which is how old the University is in 2025. I also used it to adjust the height of the base cylinder to the average seat height of approximately 400mm which is the average chair height. In order to build a shade-like effect on the roof of my design I used the parametric controls to change the radius of the cables to achieve that effect.
