Wind on the Plains is the centerpiece of Week of Welcome, catching the eyes of all attendees. The wavy timber beams sway dramatically, like the tall prairie grass in the wind, symbolizing the ups and downs of student life. Its dramatic 2 meter tall entrance draws people in, only for the pavilion to open up further, much like opportunities in university. The main central opening creates a scene of awe and interest, while also not being overwhelming, symbolizing a core facet of university life. Despite its large footprint, the pavilion feels cozy inside, creating a sense of community with others. The undulating nature of the pavilion allows participants to gaze in comfort for as long as they please, relating to the often self paced nature of post-secondary education. Once fulfilled, participants can exit the pavilion, having been comforted by the waves of the pavilion, ready to face the winds of their university education. 
Adjusting the maximum height, curvature, and the number of wood ribs and steel rods, allows for serious customization and fine tuning of the pavilion. By adjusting the maximum height, we are controlling the “awe” factor of the pavilion, balancing between something unremarkable and overwhelming. The curvature defines the “waviness” of the pavilion, exemplifying the strength of the wind. The number of wood ribs balances full exposure with natural sunlight, allowing for natural light while also providing some shelter. The number of steel rods represent strictly a structural requirement, subject to change based on final structural requirements. All in all these parametric controls allow for both the artistic and structural sides of the pavilion to be addressed.
