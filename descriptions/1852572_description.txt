This pavilion is targeted towards incoming students starting a new chapter at the University of Alberta. It is meant to represent the characteristics of a bear, nodding to the University of Alberta Golden Bears. Becoming a student at this university means being welcomed into a community of people that all have one thing in common: the pride of being a Golden Bear. Furthermore, it is intended to invoke excitement of all the things that will come with the journey of being a Golden Bear. The time spent on this journey will help individuals find themselves, and shape them into who they want to be. Passing by this pavilion in the quad is meant to remind students of this. 
Four parameters were created in this project. The first allows us to adjust the height of the columns supporting the bear’s head. Another parameter lets us adjust the size of the bear’s head, allowing us to decide how much we want to accentuate the bear’s features. Furthermore, we are able to adjust the radius of the “paw pad”. We could decrease the size of the base to allow for more room for individuals to gather around the pavilion. Lastly, the number of columns in the structure are parameterized. If we want the design to look more open, or if we want to place things inside of the pavilion, we could reduce the number of columns in the structure to make this more feasible.
