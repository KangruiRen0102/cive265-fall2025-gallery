I've decided to create a tipi design to add to the main quad pavilion space we were given to work with. This is a culturally significant structure to Alberta, as we are on treaty six territory, the traditional meeting grounds, gathering place, and traveling route of the Cree, Dene, Blackfoot, Saulteaux, Nakota Sioux, as well as the Métis Nation of Alberta. With the week of welcome being in the same month as the day of truth and reconciliation, the two events correlate and mesh well together. These two event's can create a sense of connectivity between everyone, perhaps blending the week of welcome with indigenous awareness, an environment that is ever so welcoming

As for the design itself, it is inspired by the teepee, a very significant cultural symbol for many indigenous groups in Alberta. It is a slight modification of the original teepee, as the fabric itself is on the inside of the wooden columns, being the inverse of what a model teepee would be. This stylistic choice is for ease of removal, as the fabric would be suspended with hooks from the columns. There is a number slider to control the amount of columns the teepee has. There will always be a 50 degree triangular shaped opening in the teepee to allow access, regardless of the number of columns present. The remaining sliders adjust the thickness of the columns, and the height and radius of the teepee. These feed into a python code, which adjusting the sliders immediately has an impact on the shape of the teepee.
