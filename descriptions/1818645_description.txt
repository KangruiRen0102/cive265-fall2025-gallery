1. My rationale for the design is that I wanted to create a shaded area for students to
hangout under during week of welcome. Since this event is at the end of summer it
will be hot, so shade and two long benches to sit on will be beneficial for everyone.
The pavilion creates a relaxing space to be when everywhere else is loud and
energetic. I shaped the roof to be a dome because it creates a sense protection but
also with lots of room. The open concept is also great for creating an environment
for easy socializing because it allows people to communicate and come and go
easily.
2. Using different parametric controls allowed me to create unique design
possibilities. Some controls that helped me create my design that was purposeful
were number sliders. For example, when I created the wooden benches for
individuals to sit on I wanted to be able to change the length, height, and width of
the bench all with number sliders. Implementing the sliders for these was a great
tool in case the benches needed to be a bit taller or shorted depending on average
height of the people using the benches. I also used number sliders to manipulate
the radius and thickness of the dome roof. I wanted the ability to change the radius
of the roof depending on how much shade I wanted to create. The slider for
thickness was a less functional choice and more of an aesthetic one. I personally
liked the thicker roof but if someone else wanted thinner it would be really easy to
change and see how it would look.
