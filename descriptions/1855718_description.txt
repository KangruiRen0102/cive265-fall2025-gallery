Designed as a social spot for the Week of Welcome, the pavilion turns a simple 10 × 10m footprint into a lively, permeable gathering space that feels open, sheltered, and connected to campus life. A series of vaulted timber ribs forms the main structure, tied together with slim black steel braces that give the form a clean, modern character without losing its warmth. The whole pavilion is wrapped in a soft, semi-transparent green skin to connect the University of Alberta’s colors which catches the light and creates a calm, inviting glow. It blocks wind and rain just enough to offer comfort, but still keeps people visually connected to everything happening around them.
Inside, the space is designed to encourage conversation and movement. Timber benches line the interior edges, creating comfortable spots for students to sit, relax, or hang out in groups, while the center remains open so people can easily circulate, meet new friends, and take part in activities.
The form itself came together through a lot of parametric testing in Dynamo. I worked with 5 main controls: Pavilion Height, Rib Count, Rib Depth, and Bracing Density, and number of railings and adjusted them to fine-tune the balance. Changing the height helped me find the sweet spot between an impressive arrival moment and the practical need for weather protection. Playing with the number of ribs and the density of the bracing let me shape a structure that feels solid but still visually open.
