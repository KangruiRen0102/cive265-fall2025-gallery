My pavilion, the Converging Canopy Pavilion, is designed for the center of the Quad during Week of Welcome. The shape was inspired by the movement and flow of a wave, which is why the two main wings curve toward each other. The design lets sunlight pass through parts of the structure while still creating shaded areas where students can sit or walk through comfortably. The wooden columns form the main span, and the aluminum supports hold the pavilion up while keeping the overall structure light and open.
I used several parametric controls to develop the form. Sliders adjust the number and spacing of the wooden columns, the curvature of each wing, and the rotation angle. Changing these parameters helped me test different options quickly and see how small adjustments affected the overall shape. I also added parameters for the aluminum supports to keep the pavilion stable and within the 10 m × 10 m footprint. Since all the geometry and material volume calculations update automatically, it was easier to make a final design that matched the aesthetics that worked best with my original design plan.
