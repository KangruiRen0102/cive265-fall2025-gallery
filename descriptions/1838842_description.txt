My design rationale is usability. The area of the quad this will be placed in will be off a 
high traffic pedway and usually is used for WOW and various clubs throughout the 
year. A structure that can protect against the elements, have structural integrity to 
support posters or fixtures for a extended period is perfect for the usage of the area. 
The pavilion should be used by pedestrians as shelter while walking to have a 
conversation, take pictures or just enjoy nature in a sheltered environment. The Week 
of Welcome events can utilize the pavilion to create events for the week and the 
versatility f the design allows for wide scale uses.

I had a rough idea of what I would like to end up with when I began coding at the start 
of the project. With parametric controls my code became much easier to work with as I 
could use the sliders and parametric controls over points and areas to adjust my 
design. The pavilion’s design is very interconnected as the ratio of design should be 
kept relatively unchanged with parametric changes so that the feasibility of the design 
remains intact. Knowing this, continual usage of parametric controls allowed to see 
the design better overall and make changes on the go a lot more seamless.
