The core idea behind this pavilion’s design is to foster connection and interaction with others, allowing for the meeting of new people. Featuring an adjustable number of light posts, the circular space can be more open or more intimate, allowing for easier access from different sides. The large opening acts as an invitation for any pedestrians walking by to spend a moment admiring the small fire burning in the center. Burning indefinitely, this fire serves as a focal point for kindling new relationships, particularly during the Week of Welcome, where the embers of new friendships can flourish over time. With the pavilion measuring nearly 5 meters by 5 meters, there’s plenty of space to have small social gatherings and build connections. The green overhangs and the wooden bars inside integrate the pavilion with the surrounding trees, while also mimicking the bluffs that can often be seen in rural Alberta.

Numerous parameters control the overall appearance of the pavilion. The thickness of the overhangs, the number of wooden bars, the size of the loops, and the thickness of the fire pit can be adjusted. For the posts, their height can be adjusted, which subsequently adjusts the height of the loops and bars. The most significant parameter is the number of posts, which can be switched between five to nine. At any given amount, there will always be three posts with loops on top.

Depending on the post height, it can create a more intimate space. For lower post heights, a future improvement would be dedicated seating, allowing people to sit around the fire. By changing the size of the loops and bars, it could provide slightly better cover from precipitation, but it can also provide more shade for people, thus making it easier for them to stay at the pavilion longer, and therefore promoting friendships or connections.
