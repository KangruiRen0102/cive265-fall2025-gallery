The design has 1 parabolic curve at each side of the structure that are then connected by another parabolic curve that runs perpendicular to these 2 curves and connect then with a droop in the center so it looks like the structure has a fluid like look. The structure has a lattice of metal beams that cross the structure in a perpendicular manor. These metal beams allow the structure to maintain rigidity and structural integrity. In between the metal beams there is a translucent framework of panels made of a polycarbonate material. The translucent plates allow for wind resistance and to give the structure a cool look. As the assignment asks the width, length, high of edge and Hight of middle can be adjusted as well as the number of beams that form the structure.
