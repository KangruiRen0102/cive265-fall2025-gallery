The wave of welcome pavilion was created as a sculptural gateway that reflects the energy, movement, and anticipation of the week of welcome. The rows of steel ribs form a series of rising and falling waves, symbolizing the new experiences, connections, and personal growth that students encounter as they begin their university journey. As people walk underneath, the alternating pattern of curved steel and warm wood bracing creates a sense of motion and openness. The material choice is deliberate as the steel ribs develop a sense of strength and stability, while the wood beams introduce warmth and familiarity. As a whole, it creates a sense of welcome and curiosity. The pavilion encourages exploration from different angles. With the overall sweeping arches from afar to draw attention and make it recognizable. Up close, the interwoven nature of the timber bracing would cause abstract patterns formed from light and shadows, inviting new students to pause, gather, and interact. The intention of the structure is to create moments of connection, reflection, and excitement. These are all qualities that define the week of welcome. The series of parametric controls play an important role in shaping the pavilion's final form. By adjusting parameters such as the number of ribs, wave amplitude, curve frequency, cross-brace density, and material dimensions allows for a complete change in how the structure feels and looks. Increasing the amplitude creates a more dramatic and expressive profile, while adjusting the rib count and cross-brace density changes the sense of enclosure. Tuning these parameters changes the visual structure and overall openness, which changes how people interact with it. Through these parametric explorations, the pavilion evolves into a form that balances lightness, rhythm, and warmth, ultimately reinforcing its purpose as a welcoming, expressive and memorable week of welcome installation.
