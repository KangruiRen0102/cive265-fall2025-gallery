My Arch Canopy Pavilion stands as a welcoming, wholesome landmark for students during the week of welcome. The pavilion uses a series of slick smooth timber ribs to create the overarching look. I decided on this shape because I like the idea of having something to walk under and I think that gives the pedestrians an interesting and eye catching thing to do. Its a futuristic design to give people a warm welcome to the university and make everyone feel included and excited to be here. I used many different parameter sliders to adjust my design and make it fit the rationale I was looking for, my sliders helped me try new things and find what I liked the look of the most. My Arch Canopy Pavilion demonstrates character, design and welcoming to the university campus main quad.
