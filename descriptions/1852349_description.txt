For my design, I wanted to have an open concept to exemplify the overall energy of the week of welcome. As the pavilion does not have any walls, pedestrians are able to enter from every side, “welcoming” more people into the pavilion. The metal squares around the circumference would also provide shade without completely cutting out the light, contributing to the welcome atmosphere. The height of the pavilion also allows it to be a center piece, drawing in crowds in order to welcome more new students into the university. 

I used the parametric controls in order to create the most friendly and welcoming design. One of the parameters I could change was the height of the structure. Being able to quickly switch this value out helped a lot with the design, because if the structure was too tall, it looked imposing, but if it was too short, it would not have the center piece quality that I was looking for. I used parametric control for the amount of pillars for the same reason: the structure looked strange if there were too few pillars, yet too many pillars would reduce the entry space of the pavilion. The rotation angle parametric for the pillars allowed me to find an angle that would give the structure a wider circumference without needing to increase the height of the structure in order to make sure the design did not look bottom heavy. I had the same strategy with deciding the diameter of the pillars, having the parametric control allowed me to choose a diameter that looked the best in conjunction with the rest of the pavilion.
