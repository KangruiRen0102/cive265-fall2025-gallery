My goal in building this pavilion was to evoke a sense of calm within new students who may feel overwhelmed by the hectic campus environment at the University of Alberta. The "Tide and Tranquility" pavilion was made to create a calm and welcoming space. The roof made into sine and cosine curves imitate the gentle motion of ocean waves, creating a soothing feeling as students walk underneath. The vertical supports are spaced out to show openness and allowing natural sunlight and breeze to enter. Parametric controls allowed me to experiment with the visual flow of the design. For example, the sine and cosine waves are able to be adjusted by amplitude and height, which contributed to how high or low the waves rise. This affected the design's functionality as well as the feelings it evokes into students. Additionally, modifying the support beam placement ensured structural feasibility. By adjusting these parameters iteratively, I was able to achieve the final result that balances structural stability, visual effect, and providing a calming student experience aligning with the Week Of Welcome goal of creating a memorable experience for new students on campus.
