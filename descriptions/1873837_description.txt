The experience that I want the pedestrians to have is for them to feel like they are starting a new adventure whenever they enter the university. For the week of welcome this will be a good addition to the campus because the new students will be able to interact with the structure and walk through it. This helps to create a sense of arrival and unity because when all of the new students walk through it together, they will be beginning their university careers together. I used the parametric controls through the use of the number slider nodes, the number slider nodes allowed me to check different possibilities fast and efficiently which helped to save time. Using number sliders was a much better option than using the code blocks for all of the number inputs because with the code blocks it can be hard to refine the design due to it taking longer to change inputs on code blocks. The rib count slider allowed me to quickly determine how many robs would look the best for this design. The rod radius slider helped me to visualize how thick I wanted the rods to look. The segments per rib slider allowed me to see how smooth I wanted the surface of the rods to become. These parametric design tools helped me explore different possibilities and allowed me to perfect the design. The material for the rods that arch across the area is steel, and the material for the footing is concrete.
