I created The Ribcage Pavilion to inspire perspective in new students at the UofA by alluding to the value of students and their educational journey.
The Ribcage Pavilion consists of repeating frames shrinking then growing as you move through, evoking a sense of compression and release, a method invented by legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright. This tightening and opening reflects a student’s academic journey as they are first welcomed, then later honing in on their studies, before graduating, where a new world of opportunities opens.
The name of the pavilion grew out of the idea that the student will always be at the heart of the school, there is no school without them. So, as students pass through they literally become the heart in the ribcage. This sets newcomers up with the expectation of how the UofA cares for and views its students while creating community.
For materials, I chose vertical timber pillars supporting an aluminum beam. The load carried by the columns ties into how fellow peers support each other and lift each other up.
Seven adjustable parameters make the pavilion customizable to fit user needs. These being, frame count, frame width, spacing between frames, maximum height, minimum height, beam width, and beam depth. Adjustable parameters make the unit user friendly. For example, the previously mentioned compression and release effect can be emphasized using the max and min height parameters. Further compression can be achieved by shrinking the distance between the frames and width of the frames. The main benefit of adjusting beam width and depth is knowing the cost of the materials by unit volume. These parameters shape the aesthetic appeal of the pavilion to create an attractive and welcoming space for incoming students.
To avoid exceeding the allocated space of 10m x 10m, it was built in so regardless of adjustments, they are set to cut off well within the footprint letting users take liberties while still meeting all criteria.
