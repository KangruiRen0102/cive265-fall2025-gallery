I designed this pavilion while trying to emphasize a feeling of welcoming to everyone who accesses it, while acknowledging the space it takes up on both the University of Alberta’s and Indigenous People’s land. I based the wing design on great horned owl wings as it references the UofA’s crest and represents a symbol of knowledge and wisdom, fitting for recognizing both the students pursuing their educations and the indigenous history of the place in which the pavilion stands. As well, I used rounded shapes (i.e. in the wings’ curvature and the circle on the ground) to symbolize a sense of community and unity for anyone who enters the space. Overall, it was important to me that the pavilion I designed welcomes everyone – from any history – as equals and embraces them as they take the next steps in their education.

For the design itself, I felt it was important to grant the user as much control as possible over the different dimensions, from the width of each feather to the structure’s overall height. Keeping that in mind, I used many number sliders to allow the user to adjust details as they see fit while applying bounds to each slider so the user cannot over-alter and break any aspect of the pavilion (I tested this through trial-and-error using the 3D preview). This technique allowed me to easily come up with the dimensions I thought were the best, since instead of manually changing each parameter I could easily adjust them with number sliders. For example, when the overall height of each wing is changed, the height of each feather and rachis changes proportionally. Using this feature, I was able to quickly decide what height the pavilion should stand at in order to get the most aesthetically pleasing feather length. In summary, the use of number sliders as my parametric controls for almost every aspect/detail of the pavilion made trying out different ideas very simple, and allowed me to determine the most appropriate design quickly and efficiently.
