I created a customizable spiral of wooden rods with metal caps that gradually increase in height as my pavilion. I wanted something in U of A colors that was very striking and mesmerizing to look at, whilst having easy customizable parameters that allow complete design customization for the owners. Week of Welcome is about creating a memorable first impression and fostering community. As its name suggests, The Arrival Spiral was designed to be bold and captivating, immediately drawing the eye and signaling that you’ve reached the heart of campus. If you venture to the center of the spiral, you will find a plaque with a brief history of the U of A main quad. Each rod is designed to gradually increase in height along the spiral, reaching its maximum at the end. This progression symbolizes the journey of new students during the Week of Welcome, starting at the base and, through persistence and growth, ascending toward the top.

In total, my design consists of 12 parameters, 4 of which control the spiral’s shape (angle, initial radius, growth factor, and number of cylinders). These spiral parameters enabled full control over the structure layout and beam positioning, allowing me to easily experiment and find a shape that did not completely obstruct the view of the rest of the quad, whilst providing enough room for people to walk through it. In addition, there are 5 parameters controlling the dimension of the wooden and metal cylinders (heights, diameters, height increase increment). These parameters aided in finding an ideal starting height for the wooden pillars to avoid people climbing on them and finding a good ratio of wooden pillar to metal cap height.
