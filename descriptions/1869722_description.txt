1. Design Concept and User Experience
The pavilion is designed as a sculptural, flowing canopy that creates a sense of arrival and motion for pedestrians during the Week of Welcome. Its form is defined by a sweeping, curved surface that opens at both ends, guiding visitors through a dynamic sequence of spatial experiences. The wavy, patterned roof - generated from parametric sine-based curves - creates rhythmic variations of light and shadow, giving the pavilion a lively and energetic character that aligns with the excitement of campus welcome events.
The experience is both open and sheltered: visitors feel movement, direction, and interaction with the geometry as they walk beneath its contours. 

2. Parametric Controls and Design Refinement
Parameters such as the number of wavy roof curves (N), the amplitude and frequency of the waves, and the surface division count (M) directly influenced how the pavilion felt spatially - whether more open, directional, or enclosed. By increasing amplitude, for example, the roof developed a more expressive and dramatic motion, creating deeper shadows and a stronger sense of movement, and by adjusting frequency, the rhythm of the curves across the roof would make the experience more energetic and lively. Similarly, modifying the spacing and path of the main guiding curve altered how visitors naturally moved through the structure and how the openings framed their arrival. Through this exploration, the pavilion was refined into a form that supports the design rationale: an inviting, dynamic space that evokes arrival, excitement, and communal interaction.
