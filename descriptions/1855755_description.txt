My mindset entering this project was to design a pavilion where new students can rest and relax after their stressful experience of enrolling in university. I wanted the flowing pavilion to draw attention away from the stressful environment of university life and allow students to take a mental break. 

Through that, I designed it to be open on all sides and dip down like a flowing stream of water. I imagined the flexibility and freedom given to students entering university when designing the cross-section of the pavilion. The pillars on each side represent the pillars of education provided to them by the university and professors, marking a new chapter in their lives. At the base, people can sit down along the curve, while on the other side, people can enjoy the shade on the benches from underneath the pavilion.

The parameters I made allow for the length, width, and height of the entire pavilion to be adjusted. Depending on the amount of new students, the entire pavilion can be expanded to accommodate larger numbers of people. Not to mention, the quantity of pillars and their radii can be adjusted. This is to help support the structure of the flowing pavilion while maintaining open spaces to ensure people can walk through easily. Lastly, the thickness of the cross-section can be adjusted to allow different amounts of sunlight through the pavilion.
