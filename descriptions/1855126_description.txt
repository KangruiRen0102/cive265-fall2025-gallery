My design incorporates the use of the pavilion as a welcoming and social area. While providing cover to all pedestrians and guests with the roof, and having a strong set of columns to maintain the bearing weight of the structure, it is more than capable of providing shade or cover from snow or rain all year long. Although it may seem plain on the surface, all in all, the goal is to foster a sense of gathering and community; which is exactly what the Square One Pavilion provides. The name "Square One" symbolizes a fresh start to a first year students future at the University of Alberta and can be a landmark to never forget their U of A roots. By creating a rest/break stop or a simple cover for shade when touring campus before first year arrival in the hot Edmonton sun, the pavilion can create lasting memories and even make for a nice 'First Year Send-off' photo spot. Not only this, but the simplicity that this pavilion provides would save labor costs and overall costs while making construction and the AECO Business Model process quite simple, all while still being very customizable (benches, paint, art, historical information boards, etc.) With the use of parameters, it allowed me to test different roof thicknesses, column spacing, column thickness, and column/roof heights. By creating the parameters in my project, it allowed me to experiment various geometries and possible designs for the pavilion. All in all, it allowed me to narrow down possible options and refine my final design to where it is now.
