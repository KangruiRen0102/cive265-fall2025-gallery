The pavilion is designed as a tree-like structure with a steel trunk as the base and many timber branches arranged around the top of the steel trunk. The design acts as a canopy, which fits in the center of the 10x10m ground area. There are sliders that control the trunk height, trunk radius, branch radius, number of branches, and roof radius. The whole structure can be edited with these sliders and other aspects would adapt consistently. The branch endpoints are connected to points on a circle which can be altered as well. There are 2 python classes, one SteelTrunk class which defines the central trunk and can be used to calculate volume. Another TimberBranch class which defines each branch and can be used to alter their geometry or volume. The SteelTrunk uses a single instance while the TimberBranches use a series of instances. Watch nodes were used to find the quantities and volumes of the materials, which update whenever any parameters are changed. The structure creates a calm shaded area in the Quad that students can use as a meeting point during Week of Welcome. The Palm represents the long-term mark people leave on the natural world.
