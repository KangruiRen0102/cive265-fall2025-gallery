My pavilion is named Atlantis because new connections and friendships in university are unknown and out of reach like Atlantis until one finds the courage to explore the unknown to talk and meet new people. This pavilion got this name because of its structural difference between the two materials, and the contrasting design that the overall curved wood base presents with the sharp and angular glass structure, which will likely lead to some conversations being started. I want new and old students to gather in my pavilion, sit and chat with friends, meet new people and just enjoy a shaded but airy place to relax amidst the chaos of Week of Welcome. 

The parametric controls that I used in this design were the radius of the following, the two subtracted cylinders and the 6 wooden beams and 3 glass cuboid heights. The two cylinders that were subtracted from my hemisphere were controlled by a slider because I wanted the largest opening I could get in my pavilion for it to look welcoming and interesting at the same time so that when people see it the first time, it sticks and doesn’t get looked over. Out of the 6 wooden beams radii, 2 were for beams that I subtracted from my pavilion base because even with the 4 wide openings, an otherwise enclosed hemisphere doesn’t feel open and light especially during summer, with that I played around a bit until I found a radius of subtracted beams that looked aesthetically pleasing, left enough material on the sides of the base for safety and allowed the max amount of sunlight in. I have 5 cuboids that make up my center glass structure and I kept their heights as a slider so that the central structure could be made more intriguing. All of these parameters helped me reach the final design of an open, light and intriguing structure that would be a conversation starter.
