The Circle of Warmth pavilion is meant to evoke the warmth and sense of community typically developed around a bonfire. The pavilion features a “fire” made from red and orange painted steel cylinders of different heights and diameters tilted outward to make an eye-catching focal point. Around it I placed seats in a partial ring so students can sit, relax, and talk with each other around the symbolic warmth. The wooden gazebo around the whole scene gives the area a calmer and more separated atmosphere from the busy Welcome Week environment, but it is still open enough for people to walk in easily.

I used parametric controls for almost all aspects of my design to ensure that the final pavilion accurately gave users the experience I wanted for them. For the “fire” I aimed for it to be visually interesting without being overwhelming. I tried different numbers, sizes, and tilt angles for the central cylinders until the fire looked striking and dynamic without taking up too much room. These parameters are still adjustable in my model in case someone wants to change the look later. For the gazebo, my goal was to create a space that felt enclosed and distinct, but not so closed that it became difficult to enter. I also wanted the dome to be visually interesting with curves and diagonals that added complexity without it becoming cluttered. I experimented with the number of posts until I best achieved this goal. Increasing the posts made the pavilion harder to enter and resulted in more curves and diagonals on the dome raising its visual density as well, while fewer posts simplified the dome and created wider entry gaps, making the space more open. After testing different options, I decided on eight posts as it gave me the most balanced result but I kept this parameter adjustable for future changes. Additionally I have parameters controlling the size and shape of the “fire” pit, the bulge of the curves on the dome and more all contributing to the final design I settled on.
