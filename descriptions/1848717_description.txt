My pavilion is designed as an open and welcoming space using circular rods to hold up the ceiling, and a sphere structure in the middle to symbolize unity and community. This pavilion creates a sense of arrival while being easy to see and move through from any direction, hence the spacing between each wooden rod. The golden sphere structure also symbolizes accomplishment of being at the university. The stained glass ceiling allows students to look up at the sky, symbolizing the limitless opportunities to come. The gold from the ball structure and the green stained glass are used to symbolize the University of Alberta colors, giving the entire structure a personal touch. 

The height, radius, and amount of the rods can be easily adjusted using number sliders. The height of the rods were accounted for in a way where they will never overlap with the golden sphere statue. Choosing the amount of rods that will hold up the ceiling can be useful because it makes it easier to decide how open you want the space. Ceiling thickness, or glass thickness, was also controlled using a number slider. This made it easy to tune the design so the roof felt light enough but still framed the space. The start radius and number of spheres were also adjustable using number sliders. If the user wants more spheres on the top of the structure, it’s easily changeable.

The material that was used was Tudor Oak Wood, Golden Painted Steel, and Stained Glass. The tudor oak was used for the rods, and the golden painted steel was used for the sphere statue. The stained glass was used as the roof of the structure.
