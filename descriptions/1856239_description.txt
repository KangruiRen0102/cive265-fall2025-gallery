Design concept and user experience:

The pavilion concept is to represent a dove wing. Since the structure is to be built for the ‘week of welcome’, the pavilion should represent a new beginning and peaceful life. A dove is a symbol of peace and new beginnings.

The concept is to create a pavilion, where pedestrians can take a break from the noisiness of the events, and hide in the shade. There are sitting spots that can be occupied by multiple people, as well as space in the shade on the ground, perfect for a quick nap.

Parametric controls explanation: 

The 3-D model has multiple ‘integer slider controls’:
Change in the amount of the roof rods: The change in the amount of the roof rods is responsible for the amount of shade, weight, and aesthetic view of the structure. The rods always have a distance of 20 millimeters in between each other. The smaller the amount, the bigger the radius, the less shade is created.
Radius of the support columns: The support columns are made of concrete, the change in their radius is the direct change of the maximum stress they can withstand. Additionally, there is an aesthetic part of it, if the radius of the support columns matches the radius, the structure will look inconsistent.
Change in the radius of the seats, and the seat’s back supports: The amount of space that is left for people to sit is important, if too much or not enough is left, the user experience won’t be pleasing. Additionally, at the maximum radius of 450mm for the seat’s supports, it can be used as a second level of seating.
Change in the height of the seats, and the seat’s back supports: Similarly to the change in radius, the user experience depends on the height of the seats. If the seat is too high, or too low, it can negatively reflect on the time people spend at the pavilion.


*** Normal height of a seat: 430 mm - 480 mm
Normal depth of a seat: 400 mm - 500 mm
