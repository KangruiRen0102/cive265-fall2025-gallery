My design for the pavilion, a Semi-Cylindrical Arch, is directly inspired by the vast, enclosed spaces of the tennis domes I used to frequent as a kid. I wanted to recreate that feeling of shelter and focused scale within the chaotic environment of Week of Welcome.

The goal is to provide a sense of arrival and community. As students walk through, the large, singular volume acts as a clear visual anchor and a transitional space. The repetitive nature of the Timber Lattice (Material 1) guides the eye, while the surrounding Steel Panel Skin (Material 2) offers sound separation, encouraging groups to naturally gather and interact within the central area. This creates a moment of calm and shared space, fostering genuine community among new students.

The form was explored and refined using four primary parametric controls: Arch Radius & Pavilion Height tuned the scale to make the structure welcoming, and U\_Division & V\_Division balanced structural density against material elegance.

I successfully implemented full design automation, where adjusting any parameter instantly updates the geometry and the required Material Volume 2 (Steel) quantity take-off. However, the timber volume calculation proved to be exceptionally difficult due to issues with Dynamo's CPython3 environment handling nested lists from the lattice generation. After numerous attempts using recursive functions and simpler loops, the script continued to return a total volume of zero. I created a Master Timber Script" to generate the geometry and structure the data, but the final summation remains a persistent technical challenge despite my full code logic accuracy. This process highlighted the necessity of rigorous error diagnosis when combining DesignScript and CPython3 data structures. Perhaps the volume of the surface should be zero?
