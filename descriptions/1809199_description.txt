1. People who come to the Main Quad will have the opportunity to walk through the “Entrance to Beginnings,” which symbolizes stepping into a world filled with new beginnings and adventures—hence the name. For students and visitors, this may represent undertaking new challenges or starting a new journey, which they should welcome and be excited about. The design of the feature allows for banners, lights, and other decorations to be hung, or for tarps to be draped over it to create a closed shelter.
2. Parametric controls were used in this design to manage different geometrical features of the grid-shell structure. For example, if needed, the curvature of the structure can be decreased or increased depending on the desired height. The spacing of the grids can also be adjusted to create more beams, which allows for more objects to be hung. Overall, this provides more flexibility to create a structure that gives a welcoming feeling.
